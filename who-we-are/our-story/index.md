# The city's most abused creek was showing signs of healing itself this fall.

In the greenbelt behind the Providence Alaska Medical Center, where Chester Creek was left
intact and undisturbed within its natural channel, coho salmon seemed to be everywhere. By
threes and fours or half-dozens, spawning fish worked the gravels in the riffles at the ends of
the many deep pools where the clear water meandered through the cottonwood and spruce forest.

Blown-down trees reminiscent of wilderness Alaska creeks hung across the swirling water in many
places and woody debris filled a creek between banks untrampled by human feet. But the volume of
litter in the woods and the human flotsam on the water made it clear this was not your normal
Cook Inlet tributary.

## This year there were lots of them.

"We saw a pair spawning basically in the mouth of a culvert across from East High School,'' said
Doug O'Harra, a one-time newspaper reporter turned aspiring novelist who has lived in the Chester
Creek drainage for two decades.Â "I've lived here 21 years, and in all that time, I've seen only
one salmon in the Middle Fork.''

Curious, O'Harra and his wife, Helen, a school teacher whose students raise salmon in class as
part of a state education project, hiked much of the Middle Fork. They were shocked at the
number of fish.

"They had to go up a friggin' ditch that in places you can jump across,'' Doug said. "Several
times, I said, 'Look at all this crap in the creek. Salmon couldn't go beyond this. And then
we'd go a little father and there would be more salmon.
