title: Many across Asia know that change is needed in our fisheries. But not as many know how to affect that change. And even fewer are willing to roll up their sleeves and get their hands fishy diving into the root causes of issues. Ocean Outcomes fills a niche by working across stakeholders groups and at the nexus of industry, marine environments and fishing and aquaculture communities. This unique position combined with a collaborative approach to their work has made them increasingly influential in Northeast Asiaâ€™s fisheries and across their supply chains.
