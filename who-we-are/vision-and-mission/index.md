# Locally led, industry supported fishery improvements

#We envision# a future with healthy aquatic ecosystems, a plentiful wild seafood supply, and thriving fishing communities.

#Our mission# is to work with communities and seafood industry to improve the sustainability of wild fisheries. We cultivate deep relationships with fishermen, seafood buyers, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to uncover and implement local solutions to systems level problems in globally significant fisheries.

## This year there were lots of them.

"We saw a pair spawning basically in the mouth of a culvert across from East High School,'' said
Doug O'Harra, a one-time newspaper reporter turned aspiring novelist who has lived in the Chester
Creek drainage for two decades.Â "I've lived here 21 years, and in all that time, I've seen only
one salmon in the Middle Fork.''

Curious, O'Harra and his wife, Helen, a school teacher whose students raise salmon in class as
part of a state education project, hiked much of the Middle Fork. They were shocked at the
number of fish.

"They had to go up a friggin' ditch that in places you can jump across,'' Doug said. "Several
times, I said, 'Look at all this crap in the creek. Salmon couldn't go beyond this. And then
we'd go a little father and there would be more salmon.

In the greenbelt behind the Providence Alaska Medical Center, where Chester Creek was left
intact and undisturbed within its natural channel, coho salmon seemed to be everywhere. By
threes and fours or half-dozens, spawning fish worked the gravels in the riffles at the ends of
the many deep pools where the clear water meandered through the cottonwood and spruce forest.
