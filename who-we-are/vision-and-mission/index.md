##More sustainable fisheries

At O2, we’re dedicated to improving high risk fisheries globally-- the fisheries that face the toughest sustainability issues and have the most to gain from improvements. We work hand-in-hand with commercial fisheries to design plans for improvement, and we stick around to help them achieve these goals. 

**We envision** a future with healthy aquatic ecosystems, a plentiful and profitable wild seafood supply, and thriving fishing communities.

**Our mission** is to work with communities and the seafood industry to improve the sustainability of high risk fisheries. We cultivate deep relationships with fishermen, seafood buyers, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to uncover and implement local solutions to systems level problems in globally significant fisheries.

**Our experience** on the water is strong. Incubated and launched by [Wild Salmon Center] (http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org), O2 builds on a decade of work promoting sustainable wild salmon fisheries. In our new, independent form we are a global fishery improvement organization, concentrating our entire mission on helping fisheries become sustainable so that they continue to produce healthy seafood and income for fishing communities well into the future.

To learn more about how we’re implementing our mission, view our [fishery improvement projects] (/areas-of-focus/fishery-improvement-projects/), [client services work] (/what-we-do/services/), and [financial information] (/who-we-are/board/finances/).
