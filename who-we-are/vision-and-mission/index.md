## Locally led, industry supported fishery improvements

At O2, we’re dedicated to improving high risk fisheries globally. Founded in 2014, O2 was incubated and launched by Wild Salmon Center, building on a decade of work promoting sustainable wild salmon fisheries. In our new independent form we’re a fishery improvement organization, concentrating our entire mission on helping fisheries become sustainable so that they continue to produce healthy seafood and income for fishing communities well into the future. 

We envision a future with healthy aquatic ecosystems, a plentiful and profitable wild seafood supply, and thriving fishing communities.

Our mission is to work with communities and seafood industry to improve the sustainability of high risk  fisheries. We cultivate deep relationships with fishermen, seafood buyers, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to uncover and implement local solutions to systems level problems in globally significant fisheries.

See how we’re implementing our mission in the [Success Stories section] (success-stories) of our site and view examples of our work in the [Initiatives section] (initiatives).
