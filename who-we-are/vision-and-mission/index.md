## Locally led, industry supported fishery improvements

**We envision** a future with healthy aquatic ecosystems, a plentiful wild seafood supply, and thriving fishing communities.

**Our mission** is to work with communities and seafood industry to improve the sustainability of wild fisheries. We cultivate deep relationships with fishermen, seafood buyers, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to uncover and implement local solutions to systems level problems in globally significant fisheries.

**We are** a conservation organization dedicated to improving high risk fisheries globally. Founded in 2014, O2 was incubated and launched by Wild Salmon Center, building on a decade of work to promote sustainable wild salmon fisheries.
