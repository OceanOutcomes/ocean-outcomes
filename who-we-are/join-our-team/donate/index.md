##Better outcomes for people, planet, and fisheries

We believe better fisheries can uplift people, sustain livelihoods, and preserve the integrity of marine ecosystems. That’s why we work from the water up—to create meaningful change where it matters most.

Your gift directly supports our work transforming the world’s most complex fisheries into models of sustainability, equity, and resilience. Help us build seafood supply chains that serve both people and the planet, because fisheries — and the future of seafood — depend on your support.
