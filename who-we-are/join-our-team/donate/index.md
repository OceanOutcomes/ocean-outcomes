##Better outcomes for people, planet, and fisheries

**We believe better fisheries can uplift people, sustain livelihoods, and preserve the integrity of marine ecosystems.** *That’s why we work from the water up — to create meaningful change where it matters most.*

**Your gift directly supports our work transforming the world’s most complex fisheries into models of sustainability, equity, and resilience.** *Help us build seafood supply chains that serve both people and the planet, because fisheries — and the future of seafood — depend on your support.*
