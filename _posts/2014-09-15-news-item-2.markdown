Then why don't you come down and make me then. Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. OK. Moss, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Smarties cereal. Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN!

Did you see who it was? Red bearded man. Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them!

You're not comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality. We don't need no education. Yes you do. You've just used a double negative. We don't need no education. Yes you do. You've just used a double negative. So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend?
