teaser-text: Tuna, one of the highest valued and most sought after species, will continue to face unsustainable fishing practices without a collaborative international management engagement and implementation strategy.
subtitle: Tuna fisheries are some of the most complex and challenging fisheries to sustainably manage.

##Sustainable tuna management will require systemic changes in the way we consume, fish, and manage tuna.

Tuna fisheries, targeting a variety of tuna species including Bluefin, Yellowfin, Skipjack, and Albacore (<a href="http://www.atuna.com/index.php/en/tuna-info/tuna-species-guide" target="_blank">see Atuna.com</a> for more information on tuna species and tuna products), often take place on the high seas in distant waters where overlapping and opaque management regulations can make sustainable management a challenge. Further, tuna are apex predators, some species living up to 40 years, which means tuna stocks take significant time to rejuvenate. Coupled with the fact that tuna are a highly migratory species, and worth significant amounts of money both in legal and illegal markets, sustainable tuna management is a truly complex process.

Tuna fisheries management takes place via multi-national cooperation delivered through treaty systems and regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). While these systems can be effective for defining policy, they often lack the ability to implement or ensure compliance at local, national, and ocean levels, putting tuna resources at risk.

**What is an RFMO?**

A RFMO is an international body made up of countries that share a practical and/or financial interest in managing and conserving fish stocks in a particular region. These include coastal States, whose waters are home to at least part of an identified fish stock, and “distant water fishing nations” (DWFN), whose fleets travel to areas where a fish stock is found. RFMOs are established by international agreements or treaties and can take different forms. Some focus on regulating fishing for a particular species or group of species. Others have a broader mandate, with responsibility to ensure that the fishery does not negatively affect the wider marine ecosystem and the species within it. <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2012/02/23/faq-what-is-a-regional-fishery-management-organization" target="_blank">*Source: PEW Charitable Trusts*</a>

Despite these barriers, positive transformation of tuna management is gaining momentum, especially in the canned tuna fisheries (which primarily target skipjack and albacore tunas). This includes the adoption of improved management strategies through Harvest Control Rules (<a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2016/07/harvest-control-rules" target="_blank">learn more about Harvest Control Rules</a>), collaborative work through programs such as the United Nation Food and Agriculture Organization's <a href="http://www.fao.org/in-action/commonoceans/en/" target="_blank">Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction program</a> which trains local tuna managers on best practices, and a growing consumer awareness regarding the critically endangered status of select tuna populations.

##Meet O2's Tuna Expert

<img align="left" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staticassets.oceanoutcomes.org/staff+photos/danielstaffphoto1.jpg" width="320" height="320">Born and raised in London, England, Daniel has always had a passion for coastal environments, the ocean, and marine life. This passion has led to a 15 year career in the field of fisheries and marine conservation. As O2’s Policy Director Daniel is responsible for expanding O2’s portfolio of work, policies, and strategies, working closely with O2’s regional program teams to improve understanding and implementation of sustainable fishery management policies. Prior to O2 Daniel spent six years at World Wildlife Fund (WWF), most recently as Deputy Leader of WWF’s Smart Fishing Initiative. There he lead, managed, and coordinated WWF global engagement in tuna fisheries and provided strategic direction to WWF international on seafood engagement strategy. His past experience also includes a role as Senior Fisheries Certification Manager for the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) where he improved the credibility of fishery assessments, lead and managed the technical review process of the MSC fisheries team, and developed and implemented policies and processes to strengthen the MSC fisheries assessment program. When not saving the oceans Daniel is a keen climber and hiker, and he enjoys getting out into the countryside as much as he can. Daniel holds a B.Sc in Biology from Royal Holloway, University of London and an M.Sc. in Conservation from University College London.
