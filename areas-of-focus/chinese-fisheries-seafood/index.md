| ![China Program Director, Songlin Wang] (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staticassets.oceanoutcomes.org/staff+photos/songlinstaffphoto.jpg) | Songlin, who lives in China, is an experienced and passionate conservation professional. His international career includes work for The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund (WWF China and WWF International), and The Paulson Institute, among others. He has planned, led, and coordinated a number of large scale sustainable fisheries projects, aquaculture improvement projects, and wetlands conservation projects. His efforts helped guide the first Marine Stewardship Council certification of a Chinese fishery and created enabling conditions for the first two Chinese fish farms to be certified by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council. In addition to this work, he also advises leading international and Chinese NGOs on coastal and marine biodiversity conservation issues. Trained first as a marine ecologist at the Ocean University of China, and then an environmental manager at Yale, Songlin excels at exploring conservation solutions from political, market, and scientific angles. He is fluent in both Mandarin and English and in his spare time enjoys reading, traveling, sports, and keeping ornamental freshwater fish. |
