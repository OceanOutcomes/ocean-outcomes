> #####"Retailers, importers, distributors and multi-unit chains all need to be aware of the risk implications of where they source their product from and insure they aren't sourcing from IUU fisheries or fisheries and aquaculture projects that have affiliations with slave labor. This risk mitigation will not only lead to a successful business model but help in the positive promotion and consumption of seafood." - *Guy Dean, Vice President, CSO Albion Fisheries Ltd.*

IUU fisheries are a well-documented problem in many Asian fisheries, however current traceability and certification programs don’t require proof of legality from point of harvest to processor, creating loopholes where IUU product can enter seafood supply chains. We’ve been working with fisheries in Asia for over a decade, and we realized controls and data verification at the front end, between harvest and first point of processing, were missing. That’s where our traceability work comes in.

**What does traceability mean?**

A ‘traceable’ seafood product can be tracked throughout the supply chain, from source to final point of sale, to help differentiate and verify legal product from illegal product.

----

Our process includes:

* An on-site assessment of the fishery which assesses any gaps in the key data elements (KDEs) tracked and inconsistencies in the processes surrounding KDEs tracking. This includes information regarding harvest, date, buyer, port of landing, and species, to name a few.  
* Working with the fishery and any relevant supply chain partners, we then codesign a traceability workplan to address any gaps found in the assessment, ensuring relevant KDEs are tracked and passed along the supply chain.  
* This work is then integrated with any other fishery improvement workplan activities, ensuring a holistic approach to improvement.  

This on-the-water verification reconciles inputs and outputs and assures integrity of seafood entering any supply chain at the source, and it helps fisheries meet the MSC Chain of Custody standard, a requirement to sell seafood as MSC certified or in a FIP. As traceability becomes a requisite in the sustainable seafood movement, we hope to expand and customize our approach for other regions, fisheries, and supply chains looking to ensure proof of legality from point of harvest to processor.

##Meet O2's IUU Program Officer

<img align="left" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staticassets.oceanoutcomes.org/staff+photos/shannonstaffphoto1.jpg" width="320" height="320">From her undergraduate and legal studies to her current career, Shannon’s passion for the ocean has manifested itself in a drive to combat IUU fishing. As O2’s IUU Program Officer, Shannon spearheads O2’s IUU initiatives: cultivating innovative and practical policy and programmatic solutions, exploring multi-disciplinary dynamics of IUU, and invoking positive results on the water in order to combat IUU fishing. Shannon has served as an intern at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); a Sea Grant/Knauss Fellow within NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement in Washington D.C.; the Network Coordinator for the International Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (IMCS) Network; an independent researcher at a bluefin tuna farm in Malta and a traditional bluefin tuna trap in Italy; and, most recently, as a fisheries and policy/legal consultant with NFDS Africa and Stop Illegal Fishing, based both in Africa and in the U.S. Through these experiences Shannon has developed insight into the practical application of policy/legal frameworks, including specific expertise on the issues of transhipment at-sea, shark finning, the Port State Measures Agreement, the E.U. IUU regulation, the flagging of foreign fishing vessels, fisheries and food security, and legislating for an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries. Shannon holds a B.S. in Political Science and a minor in Environmental Studies from Santa Clara University; and a JD and Master in Environmental Law and Policy from Vermont Law School.
