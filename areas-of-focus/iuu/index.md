subtitle: Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported Fishing (IUU) 
teaser-text: East Asian countries like Japan, China, Korea, and Russiaâ€™s Far East are major hubs of seafood production, trade, and consumption. Loopholes and IUU hotspots in these Asian supply chains create risk and allow IUU product to enter the regional Asian and global marketplaces, negatively impacting the entire seafood industry.
