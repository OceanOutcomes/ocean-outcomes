teaser-text: East Asian countries like Japan, China, Korea, and Russia’s Far East are major hubs of seafood production, trade, and consumption. Loopholes and IUU hotspots in these Asian supply chains create risk and allow IUU product to enter the regional Asian and global marketplaces, negatively impacting the entire seafood industry.

##East Asian countries can play a significant role in the global effort to combat IUU fishing.

Globally, illegal and unreported fishing accounts for an annual economic loss of $10 to 23.5 billion, representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes of seafood. As much as 30 percent of global catch may be unreported. In addition to economic loss, IUU fishing undermines sustainable fisheries management and governance, depletes fish stocks, negatively impacts ecosystems, threatens the livelihoods and food security of coastal communities, creates unfair competition for legal fisheries and industry, and often coincides with other significant issues such as slave labor.

> #####Together, China, Japan, and Russia represent nearly 25% of global fish landings, and as a whole, Asia accounts for more than 50% of global fish landings.

East Asian countries like Japan, China, Korea, and Russia’s Far East play a major roles in the global seafood sector as producers, traders, and consumers. Unfortunately, loopholes and gaps currently exist within dominant Asian supply chains, creating risk and enabling IUU product to enter regional Asian and global marketplaces, affecting both legal industry players as well as consumers alike. 

We’re building momentum to combat IUU fishing in Asia at the source by working with fisheries, supply chain partners, and policy makers across Northeast Asia. We’re on the water working with fishermen to close loopholes where illegal product might enter seafood supply chains; we’re building support for legal fisheries through market-based incentives; and we’re bolstering industry champions who embody best practices.

##Meet O2's IUU Program Officer

<img align="left" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staticassets.oceanoutcomes.org/staff+photos/shannonstaffphoto1.jpg" width="320" height="320">From her undergraduate and legal studies to her current career, Shannon’s passion for the ocean has manifested itself in a drive to combat IUU fishing. As O2’s IUU Program Officer, Shannon spearheads O2’s IUU initiatives: cultivating innovative and practical policy and programmatic solutions, exploring multi-disciplinary dynamics of IUU, and invoking positive results on the water in order to combat IUU fishing. Shannon has served as an intern at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); a Sea Grant/Knauss Fellow within NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement in Washington D.C.; the Network Coordinator for the International Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (IMCS) Network; an independent researcher at a bluefin tuna farm in Malta and a traditional bluefin tuna trap in Italy; and, most recently, as a fisheries and policy/legal consultant with NFDS Africa and Stop Illegal Fishing, based both in Africa and in the U.S. Through these experiences Shannon has developed insight into the practical application of policy/legal frameworks, including specific expertise on the issues of transhipment at-sea, shark finning, the Port State Measures Agreement, the E.U. IUU regulation, the flagging of foreign fishing vessels, fisheries and food security, and legislating for an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries. Shannon holds a B.S. in Political Science and a minor in Environmental Studies from Santa Clara University; and a JD and Master in Environmental Law and Policy from Vermont Law School.
