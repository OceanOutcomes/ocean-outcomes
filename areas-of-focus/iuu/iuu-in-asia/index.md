teaser-text: East Asian countries like Japan, China, Korea, and Russia’s Far East are major hubs of seafood production, trade, and consumption. Loopholes and IUU hotspots in dominant Asian supply chains allow illegal product to enter the global marketplace, putting legal seafood companies and fisheries in both Asia and the West at risk.

##Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) is fishing which takes place in contradiction to laws and marine regulations. 

IUU depletes fish stocks and negatively impacts both ecosystems and economies, weakens coastal communities and puts legal fisheries at an unfair disadvantage. One in four fish is caught and traded illegally, posing significant problems for seafood buyers, coastal communities, fisheries, and marine life. On a global scale, IUU fishing accounts for USD23 billion in global economic loss annually.

> #####China, Japan, and Russia combined represent nearly a quarter of global fish landings, and Asia as a whole accounts for more than 50% of global fish landings.

East Asian countries like Japan, China, Korea, and Russia’s Far East are major hubs of seafood production, trade, and consumption. Loopholes and IUU hotspots in dominant Asian supply chains allow illegal product to enter the global marketplace, putting legal seafood companies and fisheries in both Asia and the West at risk. Our work addresses the urgent need to implement cost-effective and replicable approaches to combat illegal fishing that build value for the private sector by increasing oversight and traceability, while also complementing legislative efforts towards a foundation of legal and sustainable fisheries globally. 

We’re working at the nexus of market-based, sustainable seafood solutions to IUU in Asia; we’re on the water with fishermen to help close loopholes where IUU might enter a seafood supply chain and we’re demonstrating new models and best practices for fishermen and policy makers alike through fishery improvement.

##Meet O2's IUU Program Officer

<img align="left" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staticassets.oceanoutcomes.org/staff+photos/shannonstaffphoto1.jpg" width="320" height="320">From her undergraduate and legal studies to her current career, Shannon’s passion for the ocean has manifested itself in a drive to combat IUU fishing. As O2’s IUU Program Officer, Shannon spearheads O2’s IUU initiatives: cultivating innovative and practical policy and programmatic solutions, exploring multi-disciplinary dynamics of IUU, and invoking positive results on the water in order to combat IUU fishing. Shannon has served as an intern at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); a Sea Grant/Knauss Fellow within NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement in Washington D.C.; the Network Coordinator for the International Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (IMCS) Network; an independent researcher at a bluefin tuna farm in Malta and a traditional bluefin tuna trap in Italy; and, most recently, as a fisheries and policy/legal consultant with NFDS Africa and Stop Illegal Fishing, based both in Africa and in the U.S. Through these experiences Shannon has developed insight into the practical application of policy/legal frameworks, including specific expertise on the issues of transhipment at-sea, shark finning, the Port State Measures Agreement, the E.U. IUU regulation, the flagging of foreign fishing vessels, fisheries and food security, and legislating for an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries. Shannon holds a B.S. in Political Science and a minor in Environmental Studies from Santa Clara University; and a JD and Master in Environmental Law and Policy from Vermont Law School.
