# The city's most abused creek was showing signs of healing itself this fall.

In the greenbelt behind the Providence Alaska Medical Center, where Chester Creek was left
intact and undisturbed within its natural channel, coho salmon seemed to be everywhere. By
threes and fours or half-dozens, spawning fish worked the gravels in the riffles at the ends of
the many deep pools where the clear water meandered through the cottonwood and spruce forest.

Blown-down trees reminiscent of wilderness Alaska creeks hung across the swirling water in many
places and woody debris filled a creek between banks untrampled by human feet. But the volume of
litter in the woods and the human flotsam on the water made it clear this was not your normal
Cook Inlet tributary.
