<h2>Overview</h2>

China’s Fujian Province is the leading fishing region in China for red swimming crab (*Portunus haanii*). On an annual basis over 50,000 metric tons of red swimming crab (RSC) is caught here. RSC is not only commercially important in China, but also supplies an important export market of crabmeat, much of which is imported by the United States in the form of canned crab. The Chinese Red Swimming Crab FIP in Development, comprised of over 1000 bottom trawl and pot vessels, takes place on the Minnan-Taiwan Bank fishing grounds and is subject to a summer fishery closure common to all Chinese coastal areas. This closure attempts to protect stocks during during the RSC. However, the current lack of science based stock assessments, minimum harvestable size limit, and maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishery management strategies represent a serious risk to the fishery as little is known about the actual stock status of these species. Since 2012, many processors have found that large crabs reaching processable size, those with a carapace width of 8 cm or greater, have been decreasing in numbers. It’s estimated undersized crabs might account for as high as 80% of harvest.

##What We're Doing:

* Working with government managers and other fishery stakeholders to develop and pilot the first-ever science based total allowable catch (TAC) management framework in China.
* Convening project stakeholders, including the National Fisheries Institute (NFI) and China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA) through stakeholder workshops to review previously completed fishery assessments, discuss how to better monitor fishery bycatch, and the plausibility of transitioning to a science bases maximum sustainable yield (MSY) management approach.
* Developing a five year fishery improvement workplan based on gap analysis conducted with local Chinese fishery scientists and fishery observers and the previously completed MSC preassessment which will transition the fishery to more sustainable management.
