<h2>Overview</h2>

By volume, China is the largest squid fishing and and processing country in the world. The East China Sea, fished by Korean, Japanese, and Chinese fishing vessels, is one of the world’s most significant squid fishing grounds. It’s there that Chinese trawl, gillnet, and hook and line vessels target Todarodes pacificus, or Japanese flying squid (JFS). Through the East China Sea Squid FIP in Development O2 is working with PanaPesca, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership and Chinese processors and suppliers based in Shandong Province to convene fishery stakeholders, map currently-opaque supply chains, identify specific origin of source fisheries providing processors with squid product, and assess the biological status of JFS in the greater East China Sea region against the three principles of the Marine Stewardship Council standard. O2 and stakeholders are now working on launching a fishery improvement project to address the information gaps and performance deficiencies found in the scoping and assessment processes.

##What We're Doing:

* Facilitation of a preassessment of JFS in the Each China Sea region which analyzed JFS squid export and import data, fishing practices, biological data, and management policies to determine environmental challenges and improvement needs in the fishery.
* Collecting harvest, fishery, and supply chain information first-hand from major JFS landing ports in Shandong Province through port surveys, processing plant inspections, and fishery interviews with fishing captains and government managers. 
* Convening project stakeholders through squid industry roundtables, including the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA), to generate support, participation, and attention for more sustainable Chinese squid production in the East China Sea.
