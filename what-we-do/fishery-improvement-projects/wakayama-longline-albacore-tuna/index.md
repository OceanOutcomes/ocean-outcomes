<h2>Overview</h2>

The Wakayama Longline Albacore Tuna FIP involves a number of offshore longline harvesters that offload at Nachikatsuura port in Wakayama Prefecture, one of the most significant ports for tuna production in Japan. Yamasa Wakiguchi Co., the FIP client, is a tuna wholesaler that sources an annual 10,000 metric tons of albacore and yellowfin tuna from these offshore longline fisheries. This product stays in the domestic market and supplies major Japanese retail stores like AEON. In 2012, the fishery commissioned a MSC pre-assessment of four tuna species (albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, bluefin) which concluded that the albacore and yellowfin tuna components of the fishery could be considered “well-positioned for certification” contingent on several key improvements. The fishery is now working towards addressing these improvements through a FIP. This includes adopting harvest control rules for tuna species, expanding on-board observer coverage to collect information on non-target species such as sharks, billfish, seabirds and turtles, and implementing measures to reduce non-target catches where necessary.

##What We're Doing:

* Reviewed and updated an MSC pre-assessment previously completed in 2012. The updated pre-assessment completed by O2 identified priority environmental challenges and opportunities for improvement through a FIP.
* Development and implementation of a FIP workplan to address deficiencies found during the MSC pre-assessment, including plans to better monitor and track information on retained species, pilot a traceability system in alignment with MSC traceability/Chain of Custody standards which tracks product from point of harvest to point of final sale, develop a strategy to implement a precautionary management framework, and monitor interactions with seabirds and sea turtles. 
* Convening fishery stakeholders to generate support and funding, including facilitating matching funds and in-kind contributions for improvement efforts.
