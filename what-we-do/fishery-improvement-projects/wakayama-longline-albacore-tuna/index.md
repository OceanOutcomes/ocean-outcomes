<h2>Overview</h2>

The Wakayama Longline Albacore Tuna FIP in Development involves recruiting the participation of offshore longline harvesters that offload at Nachi Katsuura port in Wakayama Prefecture. By volume this is the most significant port for longline tuna production in Japan, with tuna accounting for 96% of Nachi Katsuura’s total landings. Yamasa Wakiguchi Co., the FIP in Development client, is a tuna wholesaler that annually sources approximately 10,000 metric tons of albacore and yellowfin tuna from these offshore longline fisheries. This product stays in the domestic market and supplies major Japanese retail stores such as AEON. In 2012, an MSC pre-assessment of tuna species targeted by Japanese longliners was conducted for albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, and bluefin tunas. This pre-assessment concluded that the albacore and yellowfin tuna components of the fishery could be considered “well-positioned for certification” contingent on several key improvements. These include adopting harvest control rules for tuna species, expanding on-board observer coverage to collect information on non-target species such as sharks, billfish, seabirds and turtles, and implementing measures to reduce non-target catches where necessary.

##What We're Doing:

* Reviewed and updated an MSC pre-assessment previously completed in 2012. The updated pre-assessment completed by O2 identified priority environmental challenges and opportunities for improvement through a FIP.
* Development of a FIP workplan to address deficiencies found during the MSC pre-assessment, including plans to better monitor and track information on retained species, pilot a traceability system in alignment with MSC traceability/Chain of Custody standards which tracks product from point of harvest to point of final sale, develop a strategy to implement a precautionary management framework, and monitor interactions with seabirds and sea turtles. 
* Convening fishery stakeholders to generate support, participation, and funding, including facilitating matching funds and in-kind contributions, for improvement efforts.
