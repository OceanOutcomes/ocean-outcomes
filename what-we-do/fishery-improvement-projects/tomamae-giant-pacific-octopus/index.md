##What We're Doing:

* Facilitation of a preassessment of the East China Sea and Yellow Sea JFS trawl fisheries which identified environmental issues in the fishery and opportunities for improvement.
* Conducted a one year monitoring project of JFS landings in Zhoushan Province to investigate harvest areas, species composition, and other related biological data.
* Convening project stakeholders through squid industry roundtables, including the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA) and Sea Farms Limited, to generate support, participation, and attention for more sustainable Chinese squid production in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea.
