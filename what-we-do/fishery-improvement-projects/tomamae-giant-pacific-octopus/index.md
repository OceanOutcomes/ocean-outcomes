<h2>Overview</h2>

In Tomamae-cho, Hokkaido, about 40% of the population of 3,200 are employed in the fishing industry, 30% of which are fishermen (2010 census). As go the trends for Japan as a whole, the industry in Tomamae is in decline, experiencing a reduction in catches, an aging of the workforce, and a lack of new interest in the industry. The Tomamae Giant Pacific Octopus FIP aims to revitalize the regions fisheries by improving fishing practices through establishing science-based management plans, initially for the octopus fishery, but then for other key species caught in the region such as sea urchin and sea cucumber. In addition to environmental work, the Kita-Rumoi Fisheries Cooperative, which manages the fishery, wants to use the FIP as a vehicle to generate further interest and investment in the region’s fisheries.

##What We're Doing:

* Convening fishery stakeholders to generate support, participation, and funding, including facilitating matching funds and in-kind contributions, for improvement efforts.
* Conducted a rapid assessment of the fishery to identify priority environmental challenges, including a harvest strategy which without catch limits or harvest control rules, no clear knowledge of the stock status of the locally-caught flatfish used as bait, and little information on the fisheries impact on endangered, threatened, or protected species. 
* Development of a FIP workplan to address the concerns found during the rapid assessment. The workplan includes plans to transition to more robust and routine stock assessments, understand and manage the bait species, and develop and implement a precautionary harvest strategy.
