<h2>Overview</h2>

The first project of its kind in Japan, the Miyagi Coho Salmon Aquaculture Improvement Project (AIP) is located in Onagawa, a deep water port on the rugged Sanriku Coast of north-central Miyagi Prefecture. At the intersection of major ocean currents, the waters in and around Onagawa are fertile and home to a thriving aquaculture industry including oyster, scallop, seaweed, and coho salmon farms. Marukin Co., Ltd., the owner and operator of a coho salmon farm in Onagawa, had it’s operations completed destroyed in the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami which devastated the region. Since 2011, regional recovery efforts supported by government investment, Fisherman Japan, and Yahoo Japan have led to a revitalized and rebuilt aquaculture industry in Onagawa. Marukin, which has reestablished net cages and resumed salmon farming now produces roughly 465 mt of coho salmon a year under the brand name “Gin-Ou (Silver King)” and is working towards Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certification by improving farming practices through the AIP process.

##What We're Doing:

* Facilitation of an ASC pre-assessment which identified priority areas for environmental monitoring and opportunities for improvement in aquaculture practices.
* Development and implementation of an AIP workplan to address deficiencies found during the ASC pre-assessment. These include initial steps of defining, gathering, monitoring, and assessing information on the farms production and effects on surrounding ecosystems. Subsequent activities will work to minimize the farms effects on the surrounding ecosystem, based on data uncovered during initial project phases.
* Convening project stakeholders to generate support, participation, and attention for sustainable seafood and aquaculture improvement efforts in the Onagawa region.
