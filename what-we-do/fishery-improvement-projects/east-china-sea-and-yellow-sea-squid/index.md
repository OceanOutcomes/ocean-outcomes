<h2>Overview</h2>

Japanese flying squid (*Todarodes pacificus*), are highly migratory, have a broad geographic distribution, and are native to both the open ocean and coastal regions of Northeast Asia. While there is great diversity and scope of Japanese flying squid (JFS) fisheries across Northeast Asia, the East China Sea and Yellow Sea Squid FIP in Development is focused on improving Chinese JFS fisheries using midwater and bottom trawls in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea. The primary markets for this product are the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, although better supply chain analysis is needed to fully understand product flow and to elucidate any other squid species product mixing which might occur. Working with Sea Farms Limited and the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA), O2 conducted a baseline assessment of the fishery which highlighted opportunities for improved fishing and management practices. These opportunities include gathering better biological data, a precautionary harvest strategy based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY), more information on bycatch of non target species, and improved supply chain transparency to deter product mixing from fisheries targeting other squid species or JFS from other regions.

##What We're Doing:

* Facilitation of a preassessment of the East China Sea and Yellow Sea JFS trawl fisheries which identified environmental issues in the fishery and opportunities for improvement.
* Conducted a one year monitoring project of JFS landings in Zhoushan Province to investigate harvest areas, species composition, and other related biological data.
* Convening project stakeholders through squid industry roundtables, including the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA) and Sea Farms Limited, to generate support, participation, and attention for more sustainable Chinese squid production in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea.
