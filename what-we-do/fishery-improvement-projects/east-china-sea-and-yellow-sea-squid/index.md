<h2>Overview</h2>

By volume, China is the largest squid fishing and and processing country in the world. The East China Sea and Yellow Sea, fished by Korean, Japanese, and Chinese fishing vessels, is one of the world’s most significant squid fishing grounds. It’s there that Chinese trawl, gillnet, and hook and line vessels target *Todarodes pacificus*, or Japanese flying squid (JFS). JFS, are highly migratory, have a broad geographic distribution, and are native to both the open ocean and coastal regions of Northeast Asia. While there is great diversity and scope of JFS fisheries across Northeast Asia, the East China Sea and Yellow Sea Squid FIP is focused on improving Chinese JFS fisheries using midwater and bottom trawls in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea. The primary markets for this product are the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, although better supply chain analysis is needed to fully understand product flow and to elucidate any other squid species product mixing which might occur.

##What We're Doing:

* Facilitation of a preassessment of the East China Sea and Yellow Sea JFS trawl fisheries which analyzed JFS squid export and import data, fishing practices, biological data, and management policies to determine environmental challenges and improvement needs in the fishery.
* Conducted a one year monitoring project of JFS landings in Zhoushan Province to investigate harvest areas, species composition, and other related biological data.
* Supporting the convening of project stakeholders through squid industry roundtables, including the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA) and Sea Farms Limited, to generate support, participation, and attention for more sustainable Chinese squid production in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea.
* Collecting harvest, fishery, and supply chain information first-hand from major JFS landing ports in Shandong Province through port surveys, processing plant inspections, and fishery interviews with fishing captains and government managers.
