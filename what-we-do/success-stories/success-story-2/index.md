The Northeast Sakhalin Island pink salmon fishery, located in the Russian Far East on the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, is an excellent example of a successful improvement project weâ€™ve nurtured and supported. Salmon are caught here primarily using coastal trap nets, but in-river fishing weirs (RUZs), beach seines, and gillnets are used less frequently. Fishing typically occurs from mid summer to early fall, and the harvest is primarily sold in Russia, although post-certification there is increasing interest from U.S. and European markets. While the improvements in this fishery culminated in a MSC certification and a more stable fishery, the certification and sustainable designation was a long time coming and the result of many years of work by O2, the fishery, and our on the ground partners.

As is common in the Russian Far East, previous to improvement efforts this fishery experienced various forms of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing (IUU), primarily in-river poaching and unlawful commercial practices, both of which are illustrated in the images below. In addition to grappling with poaching, NE Sakhalin lacked access to and engagement from international markets and the price premium and accountability these markets bring. This is a common result of IUU, as international seafood buyers are hesitant to source seafood from unimproving high-risk fisheries. Simultaneously areas of Sakhalin were subject to aggressive hatchery expansion programs which lacked a clear understanding of accompanying implications on the wild resource and surrounding environments. 

The need for improvement and changes to the fishery were imminent, and ensuring these changes came from local initiative and were fishery-led was vital to ensure the success and longevity of positive change. Working with Nogliki and Smirnykh, and Sakhalin Environment Watch (SEW), a local NGO working on fisheries issues, O2 catalyzed the improvement process.

Fighting Illegal Fishing:

A multi-faceted approach was taken to address poaching concerns. With O2 support and encouragement, six fishing companies in the region joined forces and pooled resources to pay for private anti-poaching brigades. These brigades monitor activity at main access points and patrol key rivers in the region, destroy poaching equipment, remove river blockages created for poaching purposes, and report illegal activity to local authorities and environmental groups such as SEW. An innovative approach was taken to combat commercial IUU; the initiative led by partners SEW and Transparent World held commercial fishermen fishing illegally accountable via a satellite observer program.

Every year over 400 stationary commercial trap nets are set on Sakhalin Island. The length and stationary nature of these nets make them visible from space. Using GIS mapping technology our Russian partners overlaid the coordinates of legal lease areas over the satellite images to assess the presence or absence of violations. The results, made public by O2 and SEW, showed an alarming number of infractions; nets that were much too long, nets that fished too closed to closed river mouths, and nets completed outside of fishing zones. These infractions can be seen in the following images. The effects of this project have been stunning; since the infractions were brought to light the percentage of infractions decreased 64% in a single year as Russian fisheries previously operating illegally have improved their practices.

Results of Improvement Initiatives:

With IUU curbed, NE Sakhalin was able to achieve MSC certification, opening the fishery up to international buyers such as Walmart and Whole Foods, buyers who have made clear a policy to only source salmon from a fishery that is MSC certified or in an accredited improvement pathway. Decreased in-river poaching, coupled with increased accountability in commercial practices, led to an increase in salmon returns across the region, returns which have now leveled-off and remain at a stable level. This is in sharp contrast to other regions of Sakhalin where pink salmon returns have dramatically declined in recent years. While still ongoing, the efforts and initiatives taken in NE Sakhalin have proven that improvement projects can deliver both environmental and commercial benefits for the environment, fishermen and their communities.
