The Hokkaido chum fishery is the largest chum salmon fishery in the world. While massive in volume and value, the fishery relies almost entirely on hatchery production, a consequence of the destruction of much of the riparian habitat on Hokkaido Island. According to Japanese scientific reports, 27% of  natural spawning habitat on the island has been made inaccessible to wild salmon due to dams and other river works. Until very recently, little if any effort was made to monitor, protect, and manage for the few remaining wild salmon populations.

As the global conversation surrounding sustainable seafood gained prominence, the fishery, which exports about to half of its salmon products overseas in some years, became interested in improving its sustainability to access international markets. The fishery, working with O2 staff, has made important strides to protect wild stocks and align its management practices with internationally recognized best practices. 

The first step in the improvement process was to lay the scientific groundwork, by making the first stock assessment of wild chum stocks in nearly 50 years.  For the first time, stakeholders in Japanese fisheries worked together to start developing a national wild salmon policy to guide management strategies in salmon producing regions. This established the existence and importance of unique, distinct wild salmon populations, and made their conservation a higher priority. 

With wild salmon conservation has achieved a higher profile in Japan, managing the interactions between wild and hatchery-produced salmon remains a significant issue. The fishery is now working to differentiate hatchery vs hatchery-free rivers. In one case, this has resulted in the removal of a defunct hatchery, as the image below shows. This was a highly significant event for the precedent it set, and because the fishermen were the primary advocates for its removal. In addition to efforts to protect wild salmon, hatchery marking programs are in place to better track and understand the impact of hatchery fish on wild fish.

Connected to these efforts to improve the Hokkaido chum fishery, the Shiretoko region achieved world heritage status and committed to a number of improvements for wild salmon fisheries and rivers. Seeing the need to protect wild salmon, the fishermen of the regions supported a comprehensive dam removal program. Ultimately more than 30 dams were removed to improve fish passage and spawning. Examples of these improvements can be clearly seen in the before and after sequence of images below. 

While the sheer number of hatchery fish released each year are an on-going concern, the improvements in the Hokkaido fishery should be applauded. Scientific information on both wild and hatchery salmon is readily available and the conversation regarding salmon management has expanded greatly, allowing stakeholders of all varieties a voice. Hatcheries and dams have been retooled, rivers restored and salmon habitat expanded which as set the stage for increased and more widely distributed salmon runs.
