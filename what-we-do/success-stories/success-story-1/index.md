## The Hokkaido chum fishery is the largest chum salmon fishery in the world. 

The fishery relies almost entirely on hatchery production, one of the consequences of the destruction of riparian habitat across most of Japan. According to Japanese scientific reports, 27% of natural spawning habitat on Hokkaido Island has been made inaccessible to wild salmon due to dams and other river works. Until very recently, little if any effort was made to monitor, protect, and manage for the few remnant wild salmon populations and other aquatic wildlife.

As the conversation surrounding sustainable seafood has grown, the Hokkaido fishery, which exports about to half of its salmon products overseas in some years, became interested in promote its sustainability in international markets. The fishery launched an assessment, improvement, and certification process several years ago. While MSC certification was ultimately not to be, the fishery made important strides to protect wild stocks and align its management practices with internationally recognized best practices. 

The first step in the improvement process was to lay the scientific groundwork, by making the first stock assessment of wild chum stocks in nearly 50 years.  For the first time, stakeholders in Japanese fisheries worked together to start developing a national wild salmon policy to guide management strategies in salmon producing regions. This established the existence and importance of unique, distinct wild salmon populations, and made their conservation a higher priority. 

With wild salmon conservation has achieved a higher profile in Japan, managing the potential interactions between wild and hatchery-produced salmon remains an issue. The fishery is now working to differentiate hatchery vs hatchery-free rivers. In one case, this has resulted in the removal of a defunct hatchery, as the image below shows. This was a highly significant event for the precedent it set, and because the fishermen were the primary advocates for its removal. In addition to efforts to protect wild salmon, hatchery marking programs are in place to better track and understand the impact of hatchery fish on wild fish.

Connected to these efforts to improve the Hokkaido chum fishery, the Shiretoko region achieved world heritage status and committed to a number of improvements for wild salmon fisheries and rivers. With the growing understanding of the need to protect wild salmon (due to the certification efforts), the fishermen of the regions supported a comprehensive dam removal program. Ultimately more than 30 dams were removed or modified to improve fish passage and spawning. Examples of these improvements can be clearly seen in the before and after sequence of images below. 

While the progress to date should be applauded, more work remains to improve the situation for wild fish in Japan. A formal, public Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) should be launched for the Hokkaido salmon fishery immediately. Much of the work has already been done, but there needs to be a formal commitment by the Hokkaido Fishery Cooperative to launch a FIP as well as more transparency. All baseline assessments, improvement plans, and related documents should be put online.
