The Hokkaido chum fishery is the largest chum salmon fishery in the world. While massive in volume and value, the fishery relies almost entirely on hatchery production, a consequence of the destruction of much of the riparian habitat on Hokkaido Island. According to Japanese scientific reports, more than 35% of  natural spawning habitat on the island has been made inaccessible to wild salmon due to dams and other river works. Until very recently, little if any effort was made to monitor, protect, and manage for the few remaining wild salmon populations.

As the global conversation surrounding sustainable seafood gained prominence, the fishery, which exports about to half of its salmon products overseas in some years, saw an opportunity with the MSC certification. While it ultimately exited the program, the fishery, working with O2 staff, has made important strides to protect wild stocks and align its management practices with internationally recognized best practices. 

The first step in the improvement process was to lay the scientific groundwork, by making the first stock assessment of wild chum stocks in nearly 50 years.For the first time stakeholders in Japanese fisheries worked together to establish a universal wild salmon policy to guide management strategies in salmon producing regions. This established the existence and importance of unique salmon populations, and made the conservation of distinct populations of wild salmon a higher priority. Many rivers in Japan now have wild salmon escapement goals to ensure optimal spawning returns. 

With wild salmon conservation a higher priority, a more critical approach was given to manage wild and hatchery interactions. The fishery is now working to differentiate hatchery vs hatchery-free rivers. In one case, this has resulted in the removal of defunct hatchery, as the image below shows. In addition to emphasizing wild salmon, hatchery marking programs are in place to better track and understand hatchery fish.

Connected to the effort to MSC certify the fishery, the Shiretoko region achieved world heritage status and committed to a number of improvements for wild salmon fisheries and rivers. Seeing the need to protect wild salmon, the fishermen of the regions supported a comprehensive dam removal program. Ultimately more than 30 dams were removed to improve fish passage and spawning. Examples of these improvements can be clearly seen in the before and after sequence of images below. 

While the sheer number of hatchery fish released each year are an on-going concern, the improvements in the Hokkaido fishery should be applauded and the benefits of these changes highlighted. Scientific information on both wild and hatchery salmon is readily available and the conversation regarding salmon management has expanded greatly, allowing stakeholders of all varieties a voice. Hatcheries and dams have been retooled, rivers restored and salmon habitat expanded which as set the stage for increased and more widely distributed salmon runs.
