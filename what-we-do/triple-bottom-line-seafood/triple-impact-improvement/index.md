teaser-text: The plateau in certification represents a singular challenge for the sustainable seafood movement. We have reimagined the improvement model and built a Triple Impact Fisheries Evaluation Framework to increase the viability and decrease the risk of fisheries improvement by evaluating, tracking and incentivizing improvement of fisheries’ social and financial performance along with their environmental performance.

###The sustainable seafood movement has and continues to drive improvement of upwards of 30% of global seafood production.

It has done this primarily through [Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs)] (/areas-of-focus/fishery-improvement-projects/) – multi-stakeholder interventions that leverage market forces. Unfortunately, despite the successes achieved to date, accumulating research identifies several limitations to the conventional FIP model. These include: a tendency to stall, a lack of suitability for developing world and small-scale fisheries, and a failure to accommodate social performance. This results in significant risk for stakeholders and the movement, and an uneven distribution of the costs and benefits of improvement throughout supply chains.

**This unforeseen social impact contradicts definitions of seafood sustainability which have evolved over the past 20 years to include fisher livelihoods.**

To address these limitations and to maximize the success of FIPs, Ocean Outcomes, SmartFish AC, Wilderness Markets and Conservation International’s Oceans program broadened the FIP model beyond environmental considerations to include fisheries’ social and financial dimensions by developing a <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staticassets.oceanoutcomes.org/supporting+documents/triple+impact+framework/Triple+Impact+Fisheries+Evaluation+Framework+1.0.pdf" target="_blank">Triple Impact Fisheries Evaluation Framework</a>.

####The Framework increases the viability and decreases the risk of the traditional fisheries improvement process, representing an opportunity for all working in seafood.

By design, FIPs were created to drive improvement of fisheries’ environmental performance without explicit regard for their social or financial performance. The Framework builds off – and expands on – the fundamental strengths of the traditional FIP model, including its multi stakeholder and public approaches.

####The Framework evaluates needs, plan improvements and monitors and publicly reports progress against the environmental, social and financial dimensions of sustainability.

It is built around three tools:  

  * <a href="https://fisheryprogress.org/resources/launching-fip" target="_blank">Environmental Rapid Assessment (ERA)</a> 
  * <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2cb952_2c49ff86074441428dc979cafaa5be9d.pdf" target="_blank">Social Responsibility Assessment Tool for the Seafood Sector (SRA)</a>
  * <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I8ceYdIRWSeKaqH9sTTykHXDKrRLLa29/view" target="_blank">Financial Rapid Assessment (FRA)</a>

Although the Framework is built around these three tools, it can also be used with alternatives; implementers should choose the assessment tools most relevant and useful for their contexts. However, in accordance with best practices, we recommend that implementers use tools for assessing environmental and social performance that meet international standards. 

Below we present case study examples of successful Framework pilot projects in fisheries around the globe. These examples demonstrate the Framework’s ability to empower local organizations and those working in FIPs to maximize their impact by including social and financial improvement in their work.
