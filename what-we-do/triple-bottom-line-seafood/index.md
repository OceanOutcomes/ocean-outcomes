subtitle: We are advancing a business-driven, triple bottom line approach to the challenges facing many of the world’s small scale fishers. This approach focuses on harnessing untapped financing and increasing profitability in small scale fishing enterprises to improve livelihoods and ecosystem health; creating a positive feedback loop for people, planet and profit. Through this approach, O2 and local partners create investment portfolios for small-scale fishers to improve their business practices, recapturing value lost through inefficiency, waste or inequity. Better business practices yield increased profits, which are then invested, in part, to improve the fisheries’ environmental and social performance.
