teaser-text: The Social Responsibility Assessment Tool for the Seafood Sector (SRA) is useful as a diagnostic or rapid fishery assessment tool to assess risk of social issues, to identify areas in need of improvement, and to inform the development of a Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) workplan that includes a social element. Based on international standards and best practices, the SRA covers three main principles focused on human rights, equality and equity, and food and livelihood security.

###In line with the UN Guiding Principles, the SRA serves to operationalize Principle 15, which calls for companies to undertake human rights due diligence.

The SRA is a diagnostic or rapid assessment tool for assessing risk of social issues, identifying areas in need of improvement, and informing the development of a FIP workplan that includes social improvement. It was co-produced, and thus is co-owned, by many stakeholders and organizations inside and outside of the Conservation Alliance for Seafood Solutions, including Ocean Outcomes and Conservation International.

The SRA covers three main principles: 

  * (1) Protect human rights, dignity and access to resources;  
  * (2) Ensure equality and equitable opportunity to benefit; and  
  * (3) Improve food, nutrition and livelihood security.  

Each social responsibility principle comprises a set of components, performance indicators (PIs) and scoring guideposts (SGs).

###The Social Responsibility Assessment Tool for the Seafood Sector (SRA) is one of the three foundational components of the Triple Impact Fisheries Evaluation Framework.

Used by FisheryProgress.org, the SRA was built on the Monterey Framework, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organizationâ€™s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries, and other relevant protocols and frameworks within the fields of human rights, natural resource management and development.
