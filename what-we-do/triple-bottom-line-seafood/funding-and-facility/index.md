teaser-text: We are working to create new and innovative ways to finance the transition to sustainable fisheries by examining the feasibility of a blended financing mechanism to provide upfront capital to address the improvements needed in overexploited and unsustainable fisheries. The Sustainable Seafood Fund (the Fund) is being developed to be a pioneering mechanism to combine funding from multiple sources to support fishery improvements, providing a unique opportunity for leading companies to mainstream sustainability into their business models.

###A pioneering impact investment framework

The Sustainable Seafood Fund concept under review is a pioneering impact investment framework with the overarching objective of promoting sustainable marine ecosystems and fisheries management by aligning environmental, social and financial incentives.

Ocean Outcomes has been at the forefront for many years of the development of a rigorous global FIP approach and we continue to actively engage in addressing the barriers and challenges that fisheries face in today’s world. The lack of significant, long-term financing for fisheries in transition is one of these barriers. It is simply not possible to increase the pace and scale of change required without a transformation in thinking about how we pay for the costs of change.

This innovative approach is based on the <a href="https://seafoodsustainability.org/industry/business-case/" target="_blank">business case for seafood companies</a> to invest in the long-term viability of their seafood supplies, thus reducing supply chain volatility and risk thereof, while enhancing business value and protecting reputations.

Under the Fund’s proposed model, industry partners would commit to supporting these fisheries through a volume-based fee. Partners would then benefit from the long-term, secure supply of sustainably sourced seafood. The Fund would establish a return-making financing mechanism enabling it to pool private sector capital to finance FIP projects, reduce transaction costs, achieve economies of scale, link fisheries to markets via offtake fee agreements and promote the integration of environmental, social and financial outcomes within FIP projects.
