teaser-text: We are working to create new and innovative ways to finance the blue economy and support the transition to sustainable fisheries via a blended financing mechanism to provide upfront capital to address the improvements needed in overexploited and unsustainable fisheries. The Sustainable Seafood Fund (the Fund) is being developed to be a pioneering mechanism to combine funding from multiple sources to support fishery improvements, providing a unique opportunity for leading companies to mainstream sustainability into their business models.

###A pioneering blue economy impact investment model

The Sustainable Seafood Fund concept is a pioneering blue economy impact investment model  with the overarching objective of promoting sustainable marine ecosystems and fisheries management by aligning environmental, social and financial incentives.

We believe that this approach will ensure economies of scale, consistent standards and continued market access, optimizing the success of fishery improvement initiatives. It also aims to improve the stability and scale of funding required for sustainable blue economies in wild capture fisheries.

Ocean Outcomes has been at the forefront of developing innovative and rigorous approaches to increase the social, economic and environmental benefits of fisheries. And we continue to actively engage in addressing the barriers and challenges that fisheries face in today’s world. The lack of significant, long-term financing for fisheries in transition is one of these barriers. It is simply not possible to increase the pace and scale of change required without a transformation in thinking about how we pay for the costs of change.

This innovative approach is based on the <a href="https://seafoodsustainability.org/industry/business-case/" target="_blank">business case for seafood companies</a> to invest in the long-term viability of their seafood supplies, thus supporting the development of blue economies and reducing supply chain volatility and risk thereof, while enhancing business value and protecting reputations.

Under the Fund’s proposed model, industry partners would commit to supporting these fisheries through a volume-based fee. Partners would then benefit from the long-term, secure supply of sustainably sourced seafood. The Fund would establish a return-making financing mechanism enabling it to pool private sector capital to finance fishery improvement projects, reduce transaction costs, achieve economies of scale, link fisheries to markets via offtake fee agreements and promote the integration of environmental, social and financial outcomes within fishery improvement projects.

###Proposed key socio-economic and environmental impact metrics

The Fund will track and work towards impact across the following indicators. These indicators are strategically mapped to overlap with indicators from the Sustainable Development Goals from the United Nations and the Global Environmental Facility.

**Socio-economic:**  

- Increase in number of fisher engaged in more sustainable fisheries  
- Increase in number of female fishers engaged in more sustainable fisheries  
- Increase in proportion of females in management-level positions  
- Fisher profit remains stable or increases  

**Environmental:**  

- Increased number of assessed stocks  
- Decrease in number of stocks overfished or showing a negative health trend  
- Increase in the amount of stocks managed more sustainably (over life of SFF)  
- Decrease negative impacts on other species caught  
- Decrease in negative impacts on habitat  
- Proportion of fishers in portfolio certified or reaching certifiable standard by major environmental or social standard

Key environmental metrics are those that indicate whether fisheries in the Fund are moving towards improved stock health and management, and decreased impacts on other species and the ecosystem. Key socio-economic measures are those that will indicate whether the people involved with the fishery are treated more ethically and equitably than when the project began.
