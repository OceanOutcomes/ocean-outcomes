##At Ocean Outcomes, we work hand in hand with commercial fisheries to help them become more sustainable.

Our fishery improvement work addresses the full range of major fishery challenges contributing to the global fisheries crisis. These challenges include [Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU)] (/initiatives/iuu/), overfishing, depletion of non-target stocks, habitat impacts, and management system issues such as inadequate monitoring. These issues represent serious risks to the sustainability and security of fisheries, food supplies, and human livelihoods.

Many commercial fisheries work at the margins of profitability and have limited capacity on their own to improve the sustainability of their fisheries-- that’s where we come in. Our hands-on partnership approach helps fisheries achieve meaningful improvements and allows all stakeholders to reap the tangible benefits of sustainability.
