## At Ocean Outcomes, we work hand in hand with commercial fisheries to help them become more sustainable.
Our work addresses the full range of major fishery challenges contributing to the global fisheries crisis. These challenges include Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU), overfishing, depletion of non-target stocks, habitat impacts, and management system issues such as inadequate monitoring. These issues represent serious risks to the sustainability and security of fisheries, food supplies, and human livelihoods.  

Many commercial fisheries work at the margins of profitability and have limited capacity on their own to improve the sustainability of their fisheries-- that’s where we come in. Our hands-on partnership approach helps fisheries achieve meaningful improvements and reap the tangible benefits of sustainability.

By teaming up with commercial fishermen, seafood businesses, fishery managers, and community leaders to co-design, implement, and monitor effective on-the-water improvements we can find the path forward.

A few examples of improvements that we are catalyzing include:

* Science based management improvements—such as working with KamchatNIRO in Kamchatka to develop new escapement goals for the Karaginsky Bay fishery that will allow more wild fish to spawn.

* On the ground fishery practice improvements—such as working with Russian salmon fishermen to implement enhanced anti-IUU practices, including independent observers, traceability mechanisms, and satellite monitoring that will deter and reduce IUU fishing.

* Supply chain policy improvements—such as working with Japanese stakeholders to develop a draft Wild Salmon Policy for Japan that would set escapement goals and harvest rules for wild fish for the first time.
