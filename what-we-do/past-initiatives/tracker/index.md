subtitle: Tracking and verifying credible improvements in Pacific salmon fisheries.
teaser-text: We developed the Salmon FIP Tracker to provide salmon fishery stakeholders with easily accessible information on the sustainability status of global salmon fisheries.

## The first of it’s kind, we developed and launched the Salmon FIP Tracker in 2013.

The platform tracked Pacific salmon fisheries across the globe, providing stakeholders with easily accessible information on both the sustainability of a salmon fishery and any progress being made within that fishery towards larger sustainability goals.

**With the recent launch of <a href="http://fisheryprogress.org/" target="_blank">Fisheryprogress.org</a>, a one-stop shop for information on the progress of global fishery improvement projects, we’ve decommissioned our Salmon FIP Tracker.**

Fisheryprogress.org is a collaboration of the <a href="http://www.solutionsforseafood.org/" target="_blank">Conservation Alliance for Seafood Solutions</a> and the platform has near-ubiquitous buy-in across industry, NGOs, and others working in fishery improvement. As a member of the Conservation Alliance for Seafood Solutions, we’re now tracking our projects on Fisheryprogress.org.
