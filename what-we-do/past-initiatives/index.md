teaser-text: Our supply chain initiatives work to connect source fisheries with international and premium markets. Our goal is to build value for fisheries that are committed to fishery improvement. We help strengthen relationships among fisheries, seafood buyers, and other stakeholders in the global seafood marketplace. Recent efforts include the Salmon FIP Partnership and our international "Let's Talk Fish" series that convenes stakeholders from across seafood supply chains.
