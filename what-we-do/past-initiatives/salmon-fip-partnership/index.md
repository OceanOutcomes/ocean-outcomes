## Central to our model of locally led, industry supported improvement projects is the Salmon FIP Partnership.  

A collaborative, industry-based initiative of Ocean Outcomes and leading seafood companies, the goal of the Partnership is to significantly increase the volume of sustainable or improving wild capture salmon. The Partnership supports a number of fishery improvement projects currently underway for wild salmon.
