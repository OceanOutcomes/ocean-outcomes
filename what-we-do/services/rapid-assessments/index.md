subtitle: We conduct rapid assessments of strategically important fishery species to better articulate the fisheries landscape and to clearly map out the potential for fishery improvement and third party certification of fisheries targeting these species.
---
##These assessments will help inform policy, management, funding, and the direction of sustainable seafood work across the globe.

We developed a rapid assessment protocol based on a select group of 19 especially predictive performance indicators within the three Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) principles. Using this protocol we can quickly assess any fishery, providing a clear map of the certification likelihood and fishery improvement potential, which weâ€™ve summarized below. This efficient and cost-effective assessment method is less ponderous than an MSC assessment, but still meets the Conservation Alliance for Sustainable Seafood requirements for a basic FIP and provides a great initial starting point when scoping a fishery.

To conduct the rapid assessment we summarize fishery information within each MSC principle and assign a scoring range (0-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100) to each performance indicator (any score below 60 would cause the fishery to automatically fail the MSC assessment process). Many species are harvested by multiple gear types, so we conduct rapid assessments at a more general level rather than focusing on specific gear types. To conduct the assessments we use publicly available information from stock assessments, policy documents, and reports conducted by fishery scientists at government agencies and fisheries management organizations.

Based on these information summaries, we identify key sustainability issues for each species and we make an initial determination as to fishery improvement opportunities and as to whether the fisheries for each species appeared suitable for MSC certification within the near term (roughly the next 5 years).
