##  If you’re working in sustainable seafood, we can help you deliver on your goals.

Our ever-expanding portfolio of work spans the globe. We’ve developed salmon escapement management strategies in Japan, mapped out supply chains of the highest valued seafood species in China, designed curriculum for tuna management workshops in Ghana, led anti-poaching initiatives in the Russian Far East, provided fishery risk analysis for seafood business partners, and assisted corporate hotels in implementing sustainable seafood sourcing policies.

#####Key areas of expertise include:  

**Fishery Improvement Project (FIP)**
As an organization founded on helping commercial fisheries become more sustainable, we know FIPs. Our FIP work includes the design, launch, and implementation of both basic and comprehensive fishery improvement projects. This includes fishery assessments, stakeholder mapping and convening, work plan development and implementation, project public relations, and certification guidance.

**Fishery Assessment**
Get a clear and science-backed understanding of any fishery, against any of the leading certification standards. We conduct Seafood Watch assessments, Marine Stewardship Council pre-assessments, and have [developed our own Rapid Assessment method] (/initiatives/japanese-fisheries/rapid-assessments/) as a time and cost efficient method for evaluating a fishery’s ecological sustainability and identifying major sustainability issues.

**Supply Chain Analysis**
From point of harvest to point of consumption, and everything in between, our supply chain analysis process clearly maps fishery stakeholders and stakeholder contributions, strengths and weaknesses, bottlenecks in the system, and makes recommendations for improvements in efficiencies and sustainable practices.

**Stakeholder Convening**
Getting stakeholders to the table and facilitating a constructive results-oriented discussion can be half the battle. Through fishermen and seafood buyer exchanges, fishery stakeholder workshop facilitation and development, buyer partnership facilitation, and transnational government meeting coordination, we get the right players at the table and develop solutions that stick.  

**Strategic Consultation**
Leave the development and implementation of sustainable practices to the experts. We develop sustainable sourcing policies, bycatch reduction strategies, comprehensive risk analysis reports, anti-IUU and traceability solutions, and fisheries management strategies.
