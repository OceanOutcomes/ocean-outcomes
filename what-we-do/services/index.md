##Working in fisheries improvement or sustainable seafood? We can help you deliver on your goals.

Our ever-expanding portfolio of environmental, social and economic fisheries sustainability work spans the globe. We collaborate across geographies and stakeholder groups to improve fisheries and seafood systems. Our work includes designing and managing projects and initiatives that advance social responsibility, support policy reform, improve fishing practices, and strengthen supply chain sustainability. From improving market access to crew-level protections, our approach integrates ecosystem health, community well-being, and economic viability—delivering meaningful and durable results. Key areas of expertise include:

----

##### Engage & Assess 

*Understand each fishery through rigorous analysis rooted in science, stakeholder context, and social realities.*
 
Our work begins with science, objectivity, and a clear understanding of each fishery’s unique needs. We use rigorous, evidence-based methods—paired with direct engagement with workers, communities, and stakeholders—to assess real-world risks and opportunities. As a trusted technical partner, we apply the right tools to generate insight, guide action, and shape practical solutions that can endure over time.

* Social, Financial & Environmental Assessments: Identify risks, challenges, and opportunities across labor conditions, human rights, ecosystem health, and fishery performance.
* Fisheries Management & Policy Analysis: Evaluate governance and regulatory frameworks, support evidence-based reform, and connect policy goals to practical realities.
* Systems Mapping & Supply Chain Insight: Map interconnected systems—including product flow, traceability, and leverage points for improvement across the value chain.

##### Co-Design & Implement

*Co-develop practical strategies and tools— delivered through trusted partnerships and aligned with global sustainability frameworks.*
 
Our approach starts with co-design—working with stakeholders to shape strategies that reflect both local realities and shared priorities. Because environmental and social outcomes are deeply connected, we aim to integrate both dimensions wherever it strengthens project goals. Through collaboration, we ensure that solutions are relevant, responsive, and grounded in the lived context of each fishery.

* Co-design Fishery Improvement Pathways: Work with fishery stakeholders to identify pathways toward achieving internationally recognized environmental and social standards— through collaborative planning and technical guidance.
* Implementation & Achievement: 
   * Strengthen fishery performance with science-based tools that rebuild stocks, protect habitats, and reduce ecosystem impacts. 
   * Improve working conditions, labor rights, and equity through people-centered, practical implementation. 
   * Expand access to markets and income opportunities to support the long-term viability of fishery participants.
* Strategic Advisory & Consulting: Provide guidance on policy alignment, human rights due diligence, and responsible sourcing—helping partners shape strategies that are credible, inclusive, and grounded in local realities.

*Strengthen the systems, skills, and structures that enable lasting sustainability—while supporting fisheries on the path to recognized improvement and certification.*

We believe that lasting change is built on trust. Our approach emphasizes respectful collaboration and cultural awareness, with a focus on supporting local leadership wherever possible. Through stakeholder facilitation, training, and technical support, we help create the conditions for ownership, capacity, and continuity—long after our direct role ends.

* Stakeholder Engagement & Facilitation: Foster inclusive dialogue and shared implementation through trusted, context-aware facilitation.
* Capacity Building & Training: Equip partners with tools, knowledge, and leadership capacity to carry forward change.
* Improvement Validation & Certification Support: Help fisheries demonstrate progress through credible improvement tracking, verification, and alignment with global standards.
