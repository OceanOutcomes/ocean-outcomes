##### Improvement Projects - FIPs and AIPs
 
As an organization founded on helping commercial fisheries and aquaculture operations become more sustainable, we know Fishery Improvement Projects (FIP) and Aquaculture Improvement Projects (AIP). Our improvement work includes the design, launch, and implementation of both basic and comprehensive fishery improvement projects, as well as aquaculture improvement projects. This includes assessment, stakeholder mapping and convening, work plan development and implementation, project public relations, and certification guidance.

----

##### Fishery Assessments 
 
Get a clear and science-backed understanding of any fishery, against any of the leading certification standards. We conduct Seafood Watch assessments, Marine Stewardship Council pre-assessments, and have [developed our own Rapid Assessment method] (/what-we-do/services/rapid-assessments/) as a time and cost efficient method for evaluating a fishery’s ecological sustainability and identifying major sustainability issues.

----

##### Supply Chain Analysis 
 
From point of harvest to point of consumption, and everything in between, our supply chain analysis process clearly maps fishery stakeholders and stakeholder contributions, strengths and weaknesses, bottlenecks in the system, and makes recommendations for improvements in efficiencies and sustainable practices.

----

##### Stakeholder Convenings 
 
Getting stakeholders to the table and facilitating a constructive results-oriented discussion can be half the battle. Through fishermen and seafood buyer exchanges, fishery stakeholder workshop facilitation and development, buyer partnership facilitation, and transnational government meeting coordination, we get the right players at the table and develop solutions that stick.  

----

##### Fisheries Management and Policy Analysis 

With a high level of complexity, fisheries management and policy issues often need to be addressed from many different angles. Our wide ranging expertise allows us to provide creative and practical advice to a variety of fishery issues, whether that means for example, applying stock identification tools to complex mixed stock fishery issues, designing precautionary management approaches in response to data uncertainties, designing fishery monitoring plans to collect basic catch and biological data, evaluating the implications of artificial production strategies for wild capture fisheries and populations, or delivering expert advice on certification systems. 

----

##### Strategic Consultation 

Leave the development and implementation of sustainable practices to the experts. We develop sustainable sourcing policies, bycatch reduction strategies, comprehensive risk analysis reports, anti-IUU and traceability solutions, and fisheries management strategies.
