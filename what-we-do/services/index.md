## Engage & Assess  
 
Our work begins with science, objectivity, and a clear understanding of each fishery’s unique needs. We use rigorous, evidence-based methods—paired with direct engagement with workers, communities, and stakeholders—to assess real-world risks and opportunities. 

As a trusted technical partner, we apply the right tools to generate insight, guide action, and shape practical solutions that can endure over time. Services we provide here include:

* **Social, Financial & Environmental Assessments:** Identify risks, challenges, and opportunities across labor conditions, human rights, ecosystem health, and fishery performance.
* **Fisheries Management & Policy Analysis:** Evaluate governance and regulatory frameworks, support evidence-based reform, and connect policy goals to practical realities.
* **Systems Mapping & Supply Chain Insight:** Map interconnected systems—including product flow, traceability, and leverage points for improvement across the value chain.

*Our services in action:*

### Co-Design & Implement  
 
Our approach starts with co-design—working with stakeholders to shape strategies that reflect both local realities and shared priorities. Because environmental and social outcomes are deeply connected, we aim to integrate both dimensions wherever it strengthens project goals. 

Through collaboration, we ensure that solutions are relevant, responsive, and grounded in the lived context of each fishery. Services we provide here include:

* **Strategic Advisory & Consulting:** Provide guidance on policy alignment, human rights due diligence, and responsible sourcing—helping partners shape strategies that are credible, inclusive, and grounded in local realities.
* **Co-design Fishery Improvement Pathways:** Work with fishery stakeholders to identify pathways toward achieving internationally recognized environmental and social standards— through collaborative planning and technical guidance.
* **Implementation & Achievement:** Strengthen fishery performance with science-based tools that rebuild stocks, protect habitats, and reduce ecosystem impacts—while improving labor rights, working conditions, and equity through people-centered solutions, and expanding market access and income opportunities that support the long-term viability of fishing communities.
