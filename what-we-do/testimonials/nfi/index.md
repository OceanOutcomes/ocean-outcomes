title: NFI is no stranger to working on challenging Fisheries Improvement Projects (FIP), so it made sense to partner with O2 on the first comprehensive crab FIP in China. Despite this project being largely uncharted territory, O2 maintained its ability to work in a timely and thorough manner. Their professional team requires essentially no micromanagement and integrated seamlessly with our staff and stakeholders on the ground.
