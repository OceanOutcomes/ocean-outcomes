## A Decade of Impact

For over ten years, Ocean Outcomes has been working at the intersection of fisheries, communities, and supply chains to prove that change is possible. What began as a small team with a bold idea has grown into a global effort to make seafood more sustainable, more transparent, and more equitable.

## Our Progress to Date

Together with our partners, Ocean Outcomes has turned vision into measurable results. Our work has transformed fisheries and seafood systems.

## 10 Years, 10 Stories

These videos bring our work to life. Each highlights a different story — how O2 came to be, our fisheries improvement work in action, and the voices of fishers and communities we work alongside. Watch them all to learn more about our first decade of progress and the future we’re building.

**Episode 1 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Where It All Began**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2uF8zTtVmU?si=evTtexYJUf99fLGJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Founding members Perry Broderick and Rich Lincoln share the story of how Ocean Outcomes came to be: a story of purpose and the people who believed something better was possible—for oceans, seafood, and the communities that depend on both.*

**Episode 2 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: People Behind The Work**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGr1nSvk4iQ?si=pX6j1S_67PAYCXNi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Lasting fisheries change requires more than investments in science and policy—it also requires investments in people. Hear from founding members, current staff, and core partners on how Ocean Outcomes is working to co-design practical solutions that reflect local realities, bridge perspectives, and build trust.* 

**Episode 3 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Our Approach**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5hEDgDagO4?si=AwvfbJcss9qTMLNv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*We co-design solutions with people who live and work in fisheries every day, and adapt our tools and strategies to fit the unique dynamics of each region. See how our approach bridges science and lived experience, policy and practice, environmental goals and social realities—making progress possible in places where it’s needed most.* 

**Episode 4 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Our Complementary Partners**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tsb1xRc-vcU?si=wc0-z5jyBDZwqxmG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Ocean Outcomes works alongside NGOs, governments, industry, and communities—helping connect ideas to action and filling in the pieces that make lasting change possible. In this episode, hear directly from some of our key partners about how these relationships bring real results—and why the sum of our parts is greater than any one of us alone.*

**Episode 5 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Working in High Risk Fisheries**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZARBu2JswQ4?si=eJPQZ9F-CddpM7ad" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*At Ocean Outcomes, we work in high-risk, high-impact fisheries. Why? Because these are the fisheries that shape global seafood systems — economically, socially, and ecologically. This episode highlights how we’re proving that progress is possible, even in the most complex places.*

**Episode 6 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Human Rights & Sustainability**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqNXHBY2YXI?si=lX706_0KHmNlCV93" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*We believe environmental and social responsibility go hand-in-hand, especially in high-risk, high-impact fisheries. When crew members are treated fairly, have safe working conditions, and access to communication at sea, they’re more likely to follow sustainable fishing practices. When fisheries are managed sustainably, they provide more secure livelihoods for those who depend on them.*

**Episode 7 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Emerging Technologies**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvX9T-1ZY1A?si=ic_yFzTJud5OAh4Z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*At Ocean Outcomes, we help partners adopt the tech that works for their fishery — advancing sustainability, improving livelihoods, and building trust from the water up. From Wi-Fi on distant water vessels to scalable electronic monitoring, these tools give us the visibility to make seafood supply chains more transparent, spot and address conservation risks faster, and improve conditions for crews who may be at sea for months at a time.*

**Episode 8 — 10 Years of Ocean Outcomes: Big Impacts**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/2r34RBmKyUk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*How do you know when your work in fisheries is making a difference? When a large-scale fishery association with hundreds of members launches its first-ever FIP. When regional initiatives are transforming how tuna is caught. When people across Northeast Asia are reshaping seafood—because of a seed you helped plant. Real change takes time. And 10 years on, we can see the scale of what’s possible when partnerships grow, tools adapt, and local leadership takes root.*

## Charting the Course — Together

10 years ago, a small team set out to prove that high-risk, under-resourced fisheries could become models of sustainability. Today, thanks to partners and donors like you, that proof is real. But the work ahead is urgent. Social injustices in distant-water fleets, continued pressure on marine ecosystems, and market demand for credible, transparent seafood all require practical solutions on the water.
