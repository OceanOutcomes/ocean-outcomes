## A Decade of Impact

For over ten years, Ocean Outcomes has been working at the intersection of fisheries, communities, and supply chains to prove that change is possible. What began as a small team with a bold idea has grown into a global effort to make seafood more sustainable, more transparent, and more equitable.

## Charting the Course — Together

10 years ago, a small team set out to prove that high-risk, under-resourced fisheries could become models of sustainability. Today, thanks to partners and donors like you, that proof is real. But the work ahead is urgent. Social injustices in distant-water fleets, continued pressure on marine ecosystems, and market demand for credible, transparent seafood all require practical solutions on the water.
