## A Decade of Progress

For ten years, Ocean Outcomes has been working at the intersection of fisheries, communities, and supply chains to prove that change is possible. What began as a small team with a bold idea has grown into a global effort to make seafood more sustainable, more transparent, and more equitable. This milestone is both a chance to reflect on the progress we’ve made and a reminder of the urgent work that still lies ahead.

##### 10 Years, 10 Stories

To mark this important milestone, we’re sharing weekly video spotlights that bring Ocean Outcomes’ work to life. Each short film highlights a different piece of our journey — how O2 came to be, our fisheries improvement work in action, and the voices of fishers and communities we work alongside with. Join us here each week as we reflect on a decade of progress and look ahead to the future we’re building together.

##### Charting the Course — Together

10 years ago, a small team set out to prove that high-risk, under-resourced fisheries could become models of sustainability. Today, thanks to partners and donors like you, that proof is real. But the work ahead is urgent. Social injustices in distant-water fleets, continued pressure on marine ecosystems, and market demand for credible, transparent seafood all require practical solutions on the water. 

Your support propels O2’s next decade — expanding electronic monitoring in Northeast Asia, strengthening worker training with local partners, and translating global standards into everyday practice for fishers, companies, and communities.
