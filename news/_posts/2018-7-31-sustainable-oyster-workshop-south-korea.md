###Stakeholders from South Korea’s largest oyster fishery, which produces 50,000 metric tons annually, come together for first-ever oyster improvement workshop to build consensus.

On an annual basis some 50,000 metric tons of oysters are farmed here, both for domestic consumption and for export to the United States, Japan, Canada, and the European Union. Second only to China in terms of volume, South Korea produces roughly 260,000 metric tons of oysters annually, making the Tongyeong fishery a key component of South Korea’s vibrant oyster industry.

However, South Korea’s crown jewel of oyster production faces a number of challenges; the estimated six million styrofoam buoys used in the fishery degrade overtime and leech microplastics into the surrounding region; sediment pollution is high; and recent outbreaks of oyster disease have been documented.

####To address these issues we’re generating international support and convening local knowledge towards the goal of launching a Tongyeong oyster fisheries improvement project to ensure a healthy and sustainable Tongyeong oyster fishery.  

Led by our team on the ground in South Korea, we recently convened over 70 stakeholders—oyster producers, local and regional government officials, NGOs, and academics—for the first-ever Tongyeong oyster improvement workshop.
