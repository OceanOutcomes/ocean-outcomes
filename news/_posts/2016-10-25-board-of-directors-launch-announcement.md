###Earlier this month we gained independent 501(c)(3) status, expanded staff capacity, and established a talented Board of Directors to help us scale up and increase our impact.

“Roots have taken hold and we’re growing. What an exciting time for Ocean Outcomes and our mission for healthy oceans,” says O2 President and CEO Dick Jones. “Our Board, with established expertise in East Asian seafood markets and economics, international business, and organizational effectiveness, provides the competitive edge as we lead the sustainable seafood movement in countries like Japan and China.”

In addition to East Asian fisheries and business expertise, O2 Board members have leadership backgrounds in finance, development, legal systems, fisheries management, and social entrepreneurship.

“In the sustainability movement, seafood has taken center stage. Now we need groups like O2 to ensure best practices and sustainable commitments translate into real improvements on the ground in fisheries across the globe,” says Stephan Hall, Board Chair and Principal at Avalerion Capital. “We’re ready to jump in and support O2 in any way we can.”

From an ambitious idea, to a blossoming startup, and most recently a global organization with operations in Russia, Japan, China, and elsewhere, it’s been a busy and exciting first few years for all of us at Ocean Outcomes. We’re grateful for everyone who has been instrumental in our success and we look forward to advancing sustainable fisheries in the regions which need it most.
