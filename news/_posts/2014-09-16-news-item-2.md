It’s where we work closely with local communities and producers to co-create and implement solutions to challenging problems in high risk fisheries, and leverage support from the broader seafood industry to deliver practical and durable fishery improvements. The demand for seafood consumption is rising dramatically with global population expansion and, combined with the threats of ocean warming and acidification, we must turn the tide on overfishing, IUU, and long-lasting ecosystem damage in order to secure fish, food, livelihoods for the future. We view sustainability as a business imperative as well as an ecological and social one, and investments in effective fisheries improvement efforts by seafood businesses, philanthropic, government and impact investors are essential in meeting these challenges.

Our locally led, industry supported fishery improvement ‘brand’ is based on our experience that people need help on the ground to understand the opportunity and benefits for improving fishery performance and sustainable production, as well as how to design practical and effective actions. We target high risk fisheries whose improvement will have significant pay-off benefits and we also strive to develop approaches that will have broader application globally. Building capacity of local communities to ensure durable implementation of solutions is part of that fundamental approach. 

Beyond our on-the-water improvement projects with local producers and communities, we market an active science and technical consultancy with a mission to help our partners meet their sustainability missions.  Whether this is providing technical assistance (e.g., assessments, action plan development) to other NGO or industry FIP implementers or providing analyses to help with sustainability procurement and investment decisions, part of our mission to scale solutions for change is to actively help other parties meet their sustainability goals, which only serves to complement O2’s own fishery improvement work.
