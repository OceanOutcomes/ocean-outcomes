We face a common challenge. With global population expansion, the demand for seafood consumption is rising dramatically, combined with threats like ocean warming and acidification, we must turn the tide on overfishing, IUU, and long-lasting ecosystem damage in order to secure fish, food, livelihoods for the future. 

These challenges aren’t insurmountable, there are many sustainable fishery success stories and lessons to apply in locally relevant ways. Sustainability is a business imperative as well as an ecological and social one. With necessary investment support from fishers, seafood businesses, philanthropic, government and impact investors, we can meet these challenges.  

At O2, we work closely with local communities and producers to co-create and implement solutions to challenging problems in high risk fisheries, leveraging support from the broader seafood industry to deliver practical and durable fishery improvements.  Our ‘locally led, industry supported fishery improvement’ brand is based on our experience that people need help on the ground to understand the opportunity and benefits for improving fishery performance and sustainable production. We target high risk fisheries because their  improvement will have significant pay-off and in doing so we strive to develop approaches that will have broader application globally.

At O2, we believe in deep partnerships. To solve the shared challenges we face, we need to work together and leverage each others approaches, experience, and expertise toward common goals. We’re ready to work collaboratively to make a splash in the sustainable seafood movement, and we look forward to seeing you on the water!
