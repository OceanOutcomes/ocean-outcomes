Take the opportunity to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday, etc. etc. Theme: we’re expanding and we’ve grown drastically, and a lot has happened since we officially launched O2 in New Orleans last February. That’s less than a year ago! Here are some of the highlights from our first year:

* Western kamchatka FIP entered full MSC assessment! Pull from our previous story here. 
* IUU work in Russia - 4th year running on our joint independent observer program in Kamchatka. Developed and piloted a Catch Tracking System in Kamchatka which we plan to unveil and roll out to other Russian fisheries in 2016. More info on our IUU work to be released early 2016, stay tuned.
* Expanded our science team capacity adding Ivan. Landed additional contracts with SFW to do SFW assessments, scoping fisheries engagement in Latin America (can pull from here as needed).
* Brought seafood guru DJ on to lead the team pull from full story here
* Expanding our engagement into China, hired Songlin
* Work is really taking off in Japan, finalizing additional staff in Japan. Developed Japan Opp Report and conducted landscape rapid assessment of japanese fisheries to lead and guide sustainable seafood movement in Japan. Look for the formal release of this info in early 2016.

What’s next? A little well-deserved holiday break! When we come back after the holidays, we’ll hit the ground running. We’ll be at Malta, hosting Japanese FIP panel with fisherman from Japan. Songlin will be on full-time starting in 2016, laying groundwork to launch a FIP in China as soon as 2016. New hire in Japan to team up with Shunji, we’re close to launching the first ever FIP in Japan (the world’s leading seafood consumer). 

Wrap it up with another holiday tiding, etc. etc.
