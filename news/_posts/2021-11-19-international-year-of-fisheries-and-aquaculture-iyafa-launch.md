###Small in scale, big in value

**IYAFA Vision Statement:** *"A world in which small-scale artisanal fishers, fishfarmers and fish workers are fully recognized and empowered to continue their contributions to human well-being, healthy food systems and poverty eradication through the responsible and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources."*

Fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants are fundamental, essential and indispensable foods eaten by people around the world as part of healthy diets, cultural heritage and culinary tradition. Small-scale artisanal fishers and fish farmers produce a large portion of this food. IYAFA 2022 is an opportunity to highlight the importance of smallscale artisanal fisheries and aquaculture for our food systems, livelihoods, culture and the environment.
