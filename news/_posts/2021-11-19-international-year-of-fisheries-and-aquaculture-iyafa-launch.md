###Small in scale, big in value

**IYAFA Vision Statement:** *"A world in which small-scale artisanal fishers, fishfarmers and fish workers are fully recognized and empowered to continue their contributions to human well-being, healthy food systems and poverty eradication through the responsible and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources."*

Fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants are fundamental, essential and indispensable foods eaten by people around the world as part of healthy diets, cultural heritage and culinary tradition. Small-scale artisanal fishers and fish farmers produce a large portion of this food. IYAFA 2022 is an opportunity to highlight the importance of smallscale artisanal fisheries and aquaculture for our food systems, livelihoods, culture and the environment.

###Everyone has a role to play

IYAFA 2022 aims to raise awareness on the role of small-scale fisheries and aquaculture, strengthen science-policy interaction, empower stakeholders to take action, and to build new and strengthen existing partnerships.

Throughout IYAFA 2022 Ocean Outcomes will be advancing advancing a business-driven, triple impact approach to the challenges facing many of the world’s small-scale fishers. This approach is based on the [Triple Impact Fisheries Evaluation Framework] (/what-we-do/services/triple-impact-improvement/), developed by Ocean Outcomes and partners at SmartFish AC, Wilderness Markets and Conservation International. We will share lessons learned and insights from this work, and from our partners on the ground, through relevant fora, such as the <a href="https://ssfhub.org/" target="_blank">Small-Scale Fisheries Resource and Collaboration Hub</a> webinar series, to support small-scale fisheries improvement and IYAFA 2022.

Let’s work together for a world in which small-scale artisanal fishers, fishfarmers and fish workers are fully recognized and empowered to continue their contributions for human well-being, food systems and poverty alleviation through the responsible and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources.
