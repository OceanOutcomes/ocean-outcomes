###Cherished and loved by sushi connoisseurs, Bluefin tuna (“hon-maguro”) is a pillar of Japanese traditional cuisine. In fact, the Japanese consume 80% of the world’s Bluefin tuna. 

Unfortunately, these giants of the sea are becoming increasingly scarce; the species was recently listed as “Vulnerable” to extinction on the IUCN Red List. Commercial Bluefin tuna fishermen in Japan, whose livelihoods depend on these fish, know well the fishery is in decline but are not always in the position to take action. However, one fishery, the Iki Island pole and line fishery, has taken unique measures to halt the decline of their resource. Starting this year the fishery has voluntarily banned fishing for spawning adults, at great sacrifice and expense to their (short term) business interests.

The following lament was read aloud by one of the Iki Island commercial fishermen during an official hearing by the Japanese Fishery Agency on the situation of Bluefin tuna in Japan.

*Seafood, a cultural heritage of Japan,*  
*A blessing from the sea!*  
*We the fishermen have been a part of this*  
 
*When I became a fisherman over 30 years ago,*  
*I never doubted the infinite abundance of marine resources*  
*I was provider of Japanese food culture*  
*Fishing was an honorable, attractive profession*  
 
*What is it now?*  
*A million fishermen have been reduced to one hundred seventy thousand,*  
*Our micro enterprise is about to be disappear*  
 
*My eldest son was away studying*  
*He made the decision to return to our island this New Year*  
*To seek employment, but there is no industry to speak of here*  
*It used to be eldest sons of fishermen,*  
*Had no second thoughts about carrying on the tradition*  
*Sons of fishermen admire the work of their fathers*  
*And wishing to be like their fathers, they go to the sea*  

*But, I did not let him become a fisherman*  
*Our generation is emptying the sea of marine resources*  
*Which we should preserve for future generations*  
*What sorrow that this is the absolute truth*  
 
*Fishing tuna with pole and line*  
*Allowed me to send my three children to vocational school and university*  
*My children understand what tuna means in their lives*  
*They respect their father who cares about the tuna fishing he loves*  
*And urge me to fish tuna until my physical strength is gone*  
*I am filled with gladness!*  
*Yet when I think of the sea today*  
*I am filled with dire alarm*  
*Can tuna fishing continue?*  
 
*The world is shouting*  
*Tuna in aquariums are dying*  
*But does the world know*  
*Pacific bluefin tuna, listed as an endangered species*  
*Is fished in massive quantities on their spawning grounds*  
*Before the tuna can reproduce?*  
 
*In my hometown Iki,*  
*Many people make a living by pole and line fishing*  
*As we take action to help tuna recover,*  
*It makes us sad when we hear some say*  
*“Inefficient fishing method should disappear” or*  
*“Why not switch to a more efficient way?”*  
*If the resource is depleted, everyone suffers*  
 
*Since we fish with pole and line*  
*The resource is used sustainably*  
*By treating each and every fish with care*  
*We delivered delicious fish to the consumer*  
*Which supports small scale fishermen and their families living in remote regions*  
 
*We want the resource to recover,*  
*And to realize sustainable fisheries*  
*Better fisheries in remote regions,*  
*Will reestablish local economies*  
 
*We’ve been demanding the the Fisheries Agency limit the fishery*  
*To ban fishing during spawning season*  
*But there is still no effective regulation against massive fishing during spawning season*  
*And this fishing is about to start again*  

*If technologies and fishing exceed natural production*  
*Resources will diminish without effective regulation*  
*If the fishing takes place as usual this year,*  
*We think tuna will be no more in the Sea of Japan*  
*What can we do as fishermen?*  
*We must continue to make our voices heard*  
 
*Those of you reading this*  
*Are interested in resource management*  
*Please tell as many people as possible,*  
*Of the story you’ve just read*  
*If people know the truth*  
*Maybe things that did not change in the past will change*  
*If that happens tuna resources could recover*  

*And my sons who work in other industries*  
*Will once again be proud*  
*And a father will welcome his sons into his profession*  
*With appropriate resource management,*  
*Fishing industries can become revitalized*  
*Resulting in the rebirth of remote areas*  

*Kazunari Ogata*  
*Secretary General, Iki Tuna Resource Group*
