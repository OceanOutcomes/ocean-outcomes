##China developments post

Last summer China’s stock market plummeted more than 30 per cent and this summer the economy is still working tirelessly to claw its way out of debt (Financial Times). Policy-makers and regulators may need look no further than to China’s expansive coastline and booming fishing economy for financial leverage, albeit with significant changes to the current model.
 
Historically, sustainable seafood production has not been central to China’s political or socio-economic agenda. However, consumption trends have changed in recent years such that supply-chain transparency is rewarded by the international community, and fishermen or brokers or countries that refuse (or are unable) to provide traceable seafood are excluded from international business partnerships. China’s current economic state breeds a financial incentive for a shift in China’s seafood harvesting practices and mentality.
 
Already, positive change is on the horizon. As a means of boosting the economy, China is tightening its control on unpaid taxes, which means greater regulation and documentation at ports, minimizing the impacts of IUU fishing. 02 hopes to work with Chinese stakeholders to reimagine wild-caught and aquaculture fishery production as being more sustainable, and eventually more profitable. This rebranding of Chinese fisheries is economically vital as a means of accessing a greater consumer base and conserving finite and heavily depleted resources in China’s EEZ.
