###A new paper titled “**TITLE**” published in Science highlights the need for ocean science to evolve to address the social challenges in the seafood sector. 

Authored by Conservation International (CI) and leading researchers in the field, including contributions from Ocean Outcomes, the paper is a response to recent investigative reports by the Associated Press, New York Times, and the Guardian which highlighted social abuse in select seafood supply chains.
 
> “The scientific community has not kept pace with concerns for social issues in the seafood sector,” says Jack Kittinger, CI’s Senior Director, Global Fisheries and Aquaculture and the paper’s primary author. “The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that governments, businesses, and nonprofits are working together to improve human rights, equality and food and livelihood security. This is a holistic and comprehensive approach that establishes a global standard to address these social challenges.”
 
According to CI, the paper “identifies three key principles that together establish a global standard for social responsibility in the seafood sector: protecting human rights, dignity and respecting access to resources; ensuring equality and equitable opportunities to benefit; and improving food and livelihood security.”

> **How Science Can Mitigate Social Injustice in Fisheries**

> In this Policy Forum, John N. Kittinger et al. underscore the ways in which ocean science must evolve to overcome the social challenges that plague the seafood sector, a topic that is particularly timely in advance of the United Nations Ocean Conference, which will take place between June 5 and 9. Seafood is the world’s most common food commodity and approxi­mately three out of every seven people globally rely on it as a primary source of protein. While much attention has been focused on developing sustainable fishing practices, here, the authors emphasize that social issues, such as slavery and labor rights abuses in fisheries, are also critical. In particular, women, minorities and indigenous people are often affected by such practices. To help mitigate social injustice in the fishing industry, the authors say that the research community can play a role by assessing the linkages between environmental sustainability and social issues, bringing necessary expertise together to inform responses by businesses, government, nonprofits, and communities. Evidence-based assessments are needed to understand the scale of social abuses and the efficacy of ap­proaches, particularly as governments begin to adopt existing international laws, policies, and guidance on national and regional levels, the authors say. As well, they recommend that social responsibility indicators be integrated into globally accepted sustainable seafood ratings and certification schemes, which could help reduce the prevalence of social abuses.
