###A recent partnership between Ocean Outcomes (O2) and the Taiwan Tuna Longline Association (TTLA) is helping to improve fishing practices in Taiwanese longline tuna fisheries. 

The partnership — [inked in April 2024](https://www.oceanoutcomes.org/news/leading-taiwanese-tuna-industry-association-commits-to-sustainability/) — has now produced its first Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) for 41 TTLA vessels which combined catch 3,500 metric tons of Pacific Ocean Albacore, Bigeye, and Yellowfin tuna. 

Albacore tuna from these vessels supply North American markets in the form of canned tuna. Larger sized Bigeye and Yellowfin tuna caught by FIP vessels supply premium markets in Japan and remaining catch supply more local markets within Taiwan. The sustainability work on the water as part of the FIP will have ripple effects across all these end markets. 

As part of the newly launched FIP, vessel owners, the TTLA and others will work to advance sustainability initiatives in the fishery towards the goal of achieving Marine Stewardship Council Certification by October 2029. This work includes advocating for and supporting the development of science-based fishery management strategies, expanding uptake of environmentally friendly best fishing practices and supporting initiatives that improve human rights onboard participating fishing vessels.

>**"We are very pleased to announce the official launch of the Taiwan Tuna Longline Association’s FIP, marking a significant step forward in sustainable fisheries management," said TTLA Chairman Ming-Hsin Lee. "This project not only reflects our long-term commitment to marine conservation but also highlights our leadership in promoting transparency in fisheries and raising industry standards.”**

>**“Through the FIP, we will work closely with stakeholders domestically and internationally to ensure that our fisheries management meets international standards while satisfying the growing market demand for sustainable seafood products. We will continue to lead in advancing sustainable fisheries and preserving valuable marine resources for future generations," Lee added.**

###With over 400 tuna longline member vessels in Taiwan, the TTLA is the largest tuna industry association in Taiwan. 

TTLA arranges operational logistics, facilitates catch reporting and assists in obtaining fishing licenses for its members. This role gives them significant influence within the region’s longline tuna fisheries and positions them particularly well for helping to advance sustainability work in the region. Their enthusiastic commitment to advancing sustainability within their fleets is a positive sign of Taiwan’s willingness to support a model of continual improvement. 

>**"TTLA and its members have consistently upheld a strong commitment to sustainable fisheries, environmental protection, and safeguarding human rights at sea," said TTLA Secretary General, Mr. Ke-Chen Yang. "The launch of this FIP further strengthens our dedication, ensuring we make concrete progress in resource conservation, fisheries management, and social responsibility. Through collaboration and innovation, we are focused on creating a safer, more respectful, and secure work environment for our crew while preserving valuable marine ecosystems and providing high-quality seafood that meets international standards to the global market."**

The FIP will help to generate robust fisheries data that can be provided to fishery managers. Better data will ultimately allow for more informed decision making regarding tuna stock management and precautionary harvest strategies to ensure healthy tuna populations. The FIP will also work to reduce fishery impacts on non-target species and their habitat, such as incidental catches of sharks and other non-tuna species. Core to these efforts will be expanding utilization of elogbook and observer data, as well as ensuring vessels are well prepared for appropriate management of waste and gear disposal.

The FIP will also support collaboration and meaningful engagement across different fishery stakeholders to help improve working conditions onboard FIP vessels and advance other related social responsibility efforts. By implementing the [Human Rights and Social Responsibility Policy](https://fisheryprogress.org/sites/default/files/FP_SocialPolicy_English_5.7.21.pdf), O2 and TTLA will work to ensure crew onboard vessels are being treated fairly and have access to decent working conditions. This will involve informative and open communication to ensure fishers are aware of their rights and have access to grievance mechanisms, completing a social risk assessment utilizing the Social Responsibility Assessment (SRA) tool, and creating a social work plan to address any high risk indicators that may arise. 

>**“By fostering a culture of sustainable practices and innovation, we aim to empower the fishing community to not only meet international standards but also lead the way in responsible fishing practices. Together, we’re building a more resilient future for the industry, where sustainability, social responsibility and profitability go hand in hand,” said Kevin Lin, who supports Ocean Outcomes’s work in Taiwan. “This will help to ensure the longevity of both our fisheries and the marine ecosystems they depend on.”**
