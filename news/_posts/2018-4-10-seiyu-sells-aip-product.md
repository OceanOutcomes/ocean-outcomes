###Praised for its exceptional quality and its environmental ambitions, Miyagi Onagawa Coho Salmon is now available at over 50 Tokyo-area Seiyu GK retail stores.

Seiyu, a subsidiary of Walmart, hopes the sales will increase Japanese awareness and recognition of aquaculture improvement and the need for more sustainable fishing and fish farming practices.

[The first project of its kind in Japan, the Miyagi Onagawa Coho Salmon AIP launched in the fall of 2017] (/news/seiyu-to-support-miyagi-aquaculture-improvement/). Since then, project partners Ocean Outcomes, Fisherman Japan, Marukin Co., Ltd., Seafood Legacy, and Seiyu have been working towards more sustainable fish farming practices. This includes monitoring the farms impact on surrounding ecosystems, evaluating the sustainability of the feed used, and developing farm policies relating to social responsibility.
