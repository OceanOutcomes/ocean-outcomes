As one of the world’s leading seafood producing, importing, and consuming nations, Japan has an inordinate influence on global fishery and ocean health. Since antiquity Japanese culture, society, and cuisine have been shaped by Japan’s relationship with the sea. These trends continue today: 

 * the per capita rate of seafood consumption in Japan is three times higher than per capita consumption in the United States
 * the fishery industry in Japan is one of the world’s largest, employing hundreds of thousands of people 
 * the bodies of water surrounding Japan, the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and Each China Seas are among the most productive in terms of biomass harvested

While rich in seafood experience, knowledge, and tradition, Japan is a relatively new player in the sustainable seafood movement. This can be attributed to a lack of consumer awareness regarding global seafood trends, limited availability of credible scientific information, a lack of a coordinated strategy to support fishery improvements, and a lack of clarity surrounding the benefits and requirements of international and national eco-labels.

To advance the global sustainability movement, we need to proactively engage the massive seafood industry in Japan, collectively identify pathways forward, and co-design solutions that increase demand and support for traditionally lacking (or previously overlooked) sustainable practices and demands.

With new attention and resources dedicated to Japan, we’re excited to announce we’ve opened an office in Sapporo, in northern Japan, and hired a full-time employee to help us more effectively implement our sustainable fisheries agenda in Japan. Our expanded on-the-ground presence in Japan has helped us better understand these hesitations surrounding a Japanese sustainable seafood movement.

Through increased supply chain engagement and leveraging of our relationships and partnerships with the seafood industry and Japanese fishermen, we’re working to close the gap between fisheries in Japan and the sustainable seafood marketplace. Our on the ground presence has already allowed us to better share pertinent information with stakeholders, clarify the need for fishery improvements and describe their implementation, and allowed us to take the lead on a collaborative improvement effort.  While we work to motivate change in Japanese fisheries, our on the ground approach ensures attitudes and motivations blossom from and take root in the fisheries themselves. 

Learn more about our Japan work through an expanded look at improvement progress in Japan, as told through the story of the [Hokkaido Chum salmon fishery] (success-stories/success-story-1).
