###We are working with Conservation International Costa Rica and local harvester associations across Costa Rica to help advance projects which support environmental sustainability and socioeconomic prosperity.

These projects — initiated in late 2020 and early 2021 — span Costa Rica’s western coast and focus on fisheries and farms producing a variety of seafood, such as snapper (pargo mancha), weakfish (corvina reyna), and white shrimp (camarón blanco). Unlike many traditional sustainability initiatives, which focus primarily on environmental indicators, our work in Costa Rica also incorporates socioeconomic improvement. 

This approach to small scale fisheries sustainability — [which we describe in more detail here] (/what-we-do/services/triple-impact-improvement/) — evaluates needs, plans improvements and monitors progress against environmental, social and financial sustainability indicators.

Community based fishery improvement projects, or C-FIPs as they have been called in Costa Rica, have quickly caught on as a way to help improve the quality of seafood production and seafood harvester incomes, while also achieving conservation goals. (<a href="https://pescandofuturoprospero.com/en/sustainable-fishing/" target="_blank">Learn more about C-FIPs here.</a>)

To wrap-up 2021, our small scale fisheries team visited three of these projects, meeting with seafood harvester associations and other local stakeholders to assess the progress of the past year and plan for 2022 work.

*Across Costa Rica there are an estimated 6,000 number of seafood harvesters, such as this one pictured in San Juanillo. Socioeconomic and environmental approaches to fisheries sustainability helps ensure local livelihoods continue to thrive while at the same time we collectively work towards conservation goals.*
