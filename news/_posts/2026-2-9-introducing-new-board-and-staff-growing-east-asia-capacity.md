###Introducing our newest Board and staff members 

We are excited to share that **Dr. Yuna Kim**, Seabird Project Coordinator at BirdLife Australia, and **Jill Swasey**, Director of Impacts, Monitoring & Evaluation at the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, have joined Ocean Outcomes’ Board of Directors.

Yuna and Jill possess a powerful combination of scientific expertise, systems thinking, and practical experience across fisheries, monitoring, and marine ecosystem sustainability. **Their background and insight will strengthen Ocean Outcomes as we seek to grow our impact.**

**Dr. Yuna Kim** is a marine conservation scientist with more than 15 years of international experience working to reduce bycatch and strengthen sustainability in commercial fisheries. She has worked closely with tuna fisheries across the Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Antarctica.

Through applied research and collaboration with government and industry partners, Yuna advances practical, science-based solutions to mitigate seabird bycatch. Her work spans observer training, adoption of best-practice mitigation measures, and innovative gear modifications, all aimed at improving outcomes in real fishing conditions and supporting healthier ocean ecosystems.

>**“I’m honored to contribute to work that tackles one of the most urgent challenges in global fisheries, reducing bycatch to conserve marine biodiversity while supporting fishing communities in the transition toward truly sustainable fisheries.” — Dr. Yuna Kim**

**Jill Swasey** is a marine scientist with more than 20 years of experience advancing seafood sustainability through rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment. At the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) she leads efforts to measure sustainability outcomes and integrate data-driven decision making across the organization.

With specialized experience in fisheries and aquaculture policy analysis, sustainability performance criteria, governance indicators, and risk evaluation, Jill designs and implements systems that inform decision making and demonstrate impact at scale. Her background strengthening accountability and learning across complex sustainability programs brings a valuable perspective to Ocean Outcomes as we continue to grow our team, partnerships, and work.

>**“I’ve followed Ocean Outcomes’ growth and impact since its early days, and I’m excited to join the Board at a moment when the organization is building momentum and charting its path for the next decade.”— Jill Swasey**
 
**Welcome Yuna and Jill — we are delighted you’ve joined Ocean Outcomes at this crucial moment for seafood and fisheries sustainability!**
