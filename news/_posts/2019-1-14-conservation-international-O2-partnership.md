###We're excited to announce a global partnership with Conservation International which will work to establish a more sustainable seafood supply chain.

By leveraging each other’s experience and expertise, both organizations will develop and apply strategic approaches that will shift fisheries toward more environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and economically viable models. 

Through the partnership, organizations will jointly demonstrate the benefits of sustainable fisheries at any scale based upon best practices in ecological, social and business performance. In addition to existing efforts, Conservation International and O2 will jointly fundraise for future projects which address the myriad environmental, social and economic issues facing many fisheries.

**“Conservation International’s partnership with Ocean Outcomes brings together our respective strengths to support the transition of fisheries to sustainable production,” said Dr. Jack Kittinger, Senior Director, Global Fisheries and Aquaculture Program at Conservation International. “Our strengths in policy reform and capacity development, together with the market and entrepreneurship expertise of Ocean Outcomes creates a powerful alliance that will improve ecosystem stewardship and support sustainable livelihoods globally.”**

This alliance will combine Conservation International’s worldwide success working with communities and governments to transform fisheries towards sustainability using a three-tiered approach of 1) implementation of effective governance; 2) building community capacities and 3) alignment of incentives for sustainable harvesting with Ocean Outcomes’ expertise in fishery improvement, management, science and supply chain.

**“From a sustainability needs perspective, developing-world fisheries are highly complex. Approaches which leverage collective tools, strategies and relationships – such as those provided with our new partnership with Conservation International – broaden the scope of our toolbox so we can collectively better address fishery needs across the globe,” said Dick Jones, President and CEO at Ocean Outcomes.**

Already, Conservation International has co-created assessment tools for evaluating fisheries’ social sustainability performance and local fishers’ organizational capacities, linking these with Ocean Outcomes’ co-developed Rapid Assessment Tool for Fisheries Improvement projects (FIPs) and market and supply chain understanding. 

###This ensures that fisheries pursuing social, environmental and economic improvements can work through a consistent and familiar process.

Conservation International and Ocean Outcomes have been on the ground together in Costa Rica, working to understand and advance improvement of socioeconomic and environmental viability of queen croaker fisheries in the Gulf of Nicoya. They are also in Suriname, assessing the actions needed to improve the sustainability of small-scale finfish fisheries. Currently, both organizations are developing joint projects in Mexico and the Galápagos Islands, among others.
