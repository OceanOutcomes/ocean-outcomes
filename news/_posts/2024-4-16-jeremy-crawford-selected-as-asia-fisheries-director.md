###We are thrilled to have Jeremy Crawford bring his extensive, diverse experience to this new leadership role at Ocean Outcomes

**16 April 2024** — In the newly created role of Asia Fisheries Director, Jeremy Crawford joins the Ocean Outcomes team and will oversee the organization’s large- and small-scale fisheries work across Asia. With years of hands-on, personal and professional experience, and a deep understanding and appreciation for Asian fisheries and seafood, Jeremy will help industry associations and supply chain actors to meet market requirements for environmental sustainability and social responsibility.

**“Asia is pivotal in global seafood production, which supports millions of livelihoods and communities as a primary source of income. My upbringing in the region, coupled with my industry and non-profit experience has equipped me with valuable insights to tackle the challenges confronting these fisheries — as I am committed to ensuring their viability and market presence, while safeguarding livelihoods,” said Jeremy.**

Jeremy grew up in a family of seafood processors working in the Asia-Pacific, and he has spent the past 15 years in various fisheries and seafood leadership positions. These include both with industry, such as Thai Union Group and the National Fisheries Institute Crab Council, and also with leading sustainability organizations, such as the International Pole and Line Foundation.

In these roles he has launched and implemented dozens of Fishery Improvement Projects, helped eight fisheries achieve MSC Certification, supported pole-and-line fisheries to achieve Fair Trade certification, led a myriad capacity development and social auditing projects, and developed and deployed cost-effective and state-of-the-art electronic monitoring and electronic reporting systems across Asia and African large-scale and coastal fisheries.

**“We are thrilled to have Jeremy Crawford bring his extensive, diverse experience to this new leadership role at Ocean Outcomes at an important time,” said Kelly Harrell, Executive Director at Ocean Outcomes. “His depth of relationships and understanding of the seafood industry will be a tremendous addition to an already excellent team that is collaboratively advancing positive change in the northeast Asia region and beyond.”**

Already in 2024, Ocean Outcomes has launched a number of exciting new initiatives, [including a pioneering education and training initiative for migrant workers in Taiwanese distant water fisheries] (/news/ocean-outcomes-partners-with-one-forty-improve-worker-conditions-taiwanese-fishing-industry/) and [a new partnership with Taiwan’s largest fishing vessel member association of 500 plus] (/news/leading-taiwanese-tuna-industry-association-commits-to-sustainability/). In addition, the team continues to implement and support dozens of FIPs across the Western Pacific and develop and implement electronic monitoring and social responsibility programs on large-scale fishing vessels.

Jeremy’s addition to the Ocean Outcomes team and its leadership is well-timed as we scale our impact in Asia by building on the successful tuna programs, projects and partnerships we have developed and led over the past five years.

**“I’m honored to be joining such a dynamic team at O2, whose mission and values resonate with my own, and I look forward to contributing to their expanding portfolio of impactful work in the region,” added Jeremy.**
