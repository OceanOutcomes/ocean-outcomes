###O2 and CAPPMA, a Chinese seafood industry group representing 1800 Chinese seafood players, sign agreement at Seaweb Seafood Summit to work towards more sustainable fisheries in China.

Dr. Cui, who leads the China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance (CAPPMA), China’s leading seafood trade association, shared insights into Chinese fishery management reform plans at the Summit and committed to working with O2 to implement these changes.
 
> **“This year is a transition year for Chinese fisheries,” said Cui. “As a global leader in production and consumption of seafood, it’s critical we take steps to make Chinese fisheries and aquaculture more sustainable. That path forward for China includes better science and fishing management policies which will ensure stocks are harvested at sustainable levels.”**
 
According to Cui, this includes setting upper limits on the total harvestable volumes of wild fisheries to reduce catches from 13 million metric tons in 2015 to 10 million metric tons in 2020, reducing fleet capacity, increasing the number and size of marine protected areas, and piloting total allowable catch (TAC) management plans based on scientific data.
 
As China produces 35% of the world’s wild and farmed seafood and is home to 25% of the world’s fishing fleet, the announcement of management reform and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing between O2 and CAPPMA is welcome news on World Oceans Day.
 
> **“Sustainable fisheries globally is unattainable without Chinese fishers, seafood industry, and government at the table,” says Songlin Wang, O2’s China Program Director. “CAPPMA collectively represents all the key Chinese players we must engage. This MoU will help us more effectively implement sustainable fisheries reform in China.”**
 
The initial focus of the MoU between CAPPMA and O2 includes a commitment to support, develop, launch, and implement fishery improvement projects (FIPs) across China. Primary fishery projects include the Red Swimming Crab fishery in the Taiwanese Bank, the Japanese Flying Squid fishery in the East China Sea, and clam fisheries of coastal Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea.
