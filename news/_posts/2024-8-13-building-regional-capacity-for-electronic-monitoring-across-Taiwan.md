###Across Northeast Asia, we are catalyzing the uptake of new technologies to support better fisheries management and improve fishing practices. 

Electronic monitoring offers an efficient and cost-effective alternative to onboard fisheries observers, and can greatly increase the availability and accuracy of fisheries data to support sustainable fisheries management. Electronic monitoring is a suite of electronic systems and human analysts to record and analyze data of at-sea fishing operations. These systems include video cameras, computer processors and sensors, Global Positioning System (GPS), and can use any combination of a variety of emerging technologies such as the cloud, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Low Earth Orbiting Satellites (LEO). Together, these systems allow for remote monitoring and recording of a vessel’s fishing activity in real time. 

Electronic monitoring in fisheries can verify the accuracy of vessel logbooks, reduce Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, increase scientific fisheries data, enhance bycatch reduction strategies; support market access; and expand authorities’ ability to make informed decisions on fisheries management and compliance.

Through a growing partnership with Fue Shin Fishery Ltd (FSF), and the National Taiwan Ocean University and Fisheries Agency of Taiwan, we are installing electronic monitoring equipment and implementing its supporting technology on distant-water longline tuna vessels. These trials are supporting two goals, (1) assisting vessels involved in our FSF Fishery Improvement Projects in gathering independent catch data, and (2) accelerating local capacity for electronic monitoring development. 

By implementing new monitoring solutions and enhancing local ability to manage these systems (for example, by supporting processes that allow for video to be reviewed and analyzed in-country) we are supporting Taiwan in improving compliance with international standards, better protecting marine ecosystems, and ultimately helping to ensure the long-term viability of its fishing industry. Over the past year, our teams have installed electronic monitoring equipment across four Taiwanese vessels with a plan to add another eight by the end of 2024. 

**The below images and their captions highlight how our collaborative work is advancing electronic monitoring in Taiwanese tuna fisheries.**

*Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) — which oversee tuna fisheries — are gradually increasing monitoring requirements. They are also calling for increased coverage and minimum observer percentages across various gear types, as well as establishing standards for electronic monitoring systems and electronic reporting.*

*Observers are independent specialists who serve on board commercial fishing vessels. They monitor and collect data on where a vessel is fishing, the type of gear used, the fishing activities occurring, catch composition, and interactions with marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and other protected species.*

*Monitoring fisheries is challenging, especially when distant water vessels operate far from shore for very long periods of time. Simply put, there are not enough observers to cover all the vessels that need monitoring. Further, the observers themselves are also required to work long hours, face a variety of occupational hazards, have personal safety concerns, and cannot provide 100% observation over the duration of a fishing trip given a vessel’s working hours.*

*Electronic monitoring offers an opportunity to address RFMO requirements and many of the challenges related to onboard observers. For example, electronic monitoring can increase observer coverage at lower costs (as vessels are often responsible for the cost of observers); increase transparency and data integrity; and contribute to more sustainable fisheries management.*

*However, Taiwan currently lacks a comprehensive electronic monitoring policy and regulatory framework, which has significant implications for the management and oversight of its fisheries.  Across Taiwan, observer coverage hovers around five percent, far below the levels necessary to ensure effective monitoring and sustainable practices.*

*So far, the team has installed and implemented electronic monitoring equipment across four vessels and plans to do another eight this year. This work is all part of two Fishery Improvement Projects led by Ocean Outcomes and FSF which are working to improve social responsibility and environmental sustainability on participating Taiwanese longline tuna fishing vessels.*

*"As we support the implementation of electronic monitoring systems in Taiwan's tuna industry, this technology will bring significant benefits. It will enhance transparency, ensure compliance with international standards, and ultimately contribute to the sustainability and profitability of our fisheries. This is a crucial step towards a more responsible and forward-thinking approach to marine resource management." - Ho-Tu Chiang, Asia Fishery Improvement Manager for Ocean Outcomes, pictured above.*
