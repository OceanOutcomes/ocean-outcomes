teaser-text: Current traceability and certification programs don’t require proof of legality from point of harvest to processor, creating a loophole at the point of harvest and processing where IUU product can enter seafood supply chains. That’s where the CTS comes in.

> #####"Retailers, importers, distributors and multi-unit chains all need to be aware of the risk implications of where they source their product from and insure they aren't sourcing from IUU fisheries or fisheries and aquaculture projects that have affiliations with slave labor. This risk mitigation will not only lead to a successful business model but help in the positive promotion and consumption of seafood." - *Guy Dean, Vice President, CSO Albion Fisheries Ltd.*

IUU fisheries are a well-documented problem in many Asian fisheries, however current traceability and certification programs don’t require proof of legality from point of harvest to processor, creating a loophole at the point of harvest and processing where IUU product can enter seafood supply chains. We’ve been working with fisheries in Russia for many years, and we realized controls and data verification at the front end, between harvest and first point of processing, were missing. 

The Catch Tracking System (CTS), is an initiative to track and verify product from harvest to primary processing to close loopholes between harvest and primary processing where IUU product might enter seafood supply chains. This new on-the-water verification reconciles inputs and outputs and assures integrity of the data entering any supply chain at the source and helps fisheries meet the MSC Chain of Custody standard, a requirement to sell seafood as MSC certified or in a FIP.

The CTS is an efficient combination of self-reporting and verification conducted on the ground by independent observers trained to monitor the implementation of the system and verify the paper and the “people” trail. An observer tracks catch data and ensures these figures align with what’s subsequently processed and shipped. By following the CTS protocol, companies capture and upload information to assure customers that they are receiving product traceable back to the source fishery.

We piloted the CTS in Kamchatka, Russia in 2015 and our goal is to implement the CTS in all of our FIPs and MSC projects. As traceability becomes a requisite in the sustainable seafood movement and seafood certifications, we see the CTS as an approach that could be expanded and customized for other regions and fisheries by both O2 and other organizations looking to secure the first segment of a seafood supply chain.
