IUU is a paramount threat to conservation and in many ways is one of the most difficult problems facing global fisheries sustainability. In certain regions of the Russian Far East the magnitude of IUU is sobering; in some fisheries estimates of IUU catch range between 1.5 and 3 times the legally reported catch. From an ecological perspective IUU catch negatively impacts fisheries by depleting resources, altering food web dynamics, and confounding fisheries management efforts. From a market perspective IUU results in unfair market competition, instability in seafood prices, and threatened food security.

IUU fishing is often classified into three broad categories; subsistence poaching, organized large-scale crime poaching, and commercial unreported or misreported catch. The root causes of IUU are complex, a mix of cultural and rural economies, inflexible, conflicting and incomplete laws and regulations, a lack of transparency, and corruption. To eliminate commercial misreporting of catches and the mixing of illegally-fished products we’re working to build a network of key suppliers and traceability protocols in areas often prone to to IUU. These efforts increase accountability and transparency and close loopholes for IUU products to enter the market. Other anti-IUU strategies we employ include independent observer programs, fishery-backed poaching brigades, and innovative technique like monitoring fishing parcels via satellite.
