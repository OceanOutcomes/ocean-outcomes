subtitle: Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) Fishing fishing threatens the sustainability of fish stocks on a global scale and accounts for USD23 billion in global economic loss annually. The rate of illegal and unreported fishing may be 18% above the legal catch on some fishing grounds worldwide. 
teaser-text: For many years, O2 staff have been promoting efforts to reduce IUU, particularly in Russia. We supported independent observers, anti-poaching brigades, satellite monitoring, and helped several Russian companies get MSC CoC certification. Overall, we have seen slow but steady progress to reduce illegal fishing and a corresponding increase in legal, sustainable fishing. We have also learned a lot.
