## The Catch Tracking System (CTS) is an initiative to track product from “net to plate,” to provide a higher level of assurance that fish is not mixed with product that is from illegal, unreported or unregulated sources.

Currently, chain of custody schemes operate on the honor system in terms of initial data input for the first point of entry at the processor level, creating a loophole for illegal fisheries, because there is no verification back to the origin of harvest. Russia is a very important country for seafood supply, but well-known for issues of IUU and corruption and in such high risk fisheries, additional precautions are needed to ensure compliance. By following the CTS protocol, companies will capture information to assure customers that they are receiving product they can track back to the fishery from where it was sourced.

Catch Tracking System steps include:

The fishing company will confirm the legality of catch at landing - the company will upload (to either a cloud or a dropbox, tbd) the harvest permit for each brigadier responsible for each net 
For each harvest, the brigadier will assign an origin ID at the point of harvest. This number will contain:  
O2’s commodity code (see Appendix A), AND the parcel number, AND a four digit sequence number (beginning with 0001, to denote the order in which a catch tracking master document is issued), which will be on all documentation and product packaging accompanying shipments leaving the processing facility to ensure traceability of its final product form and sale.  
The processor will create a Catch Tracking Master document containing the following information, to be entered into an excel sheet and the hard copy stored at the first point of processing. 
 
###The Future

Governments around the globe are concluding multilateral agreements to combat IUU and Russia is no exception, having signed agreements with China, Japan, the E.U., and most recently, with the U.S. Additionally, the increasing scrutiny of the global supply chain and the strengthening of import requirements for seafood, specifically in the U.S. and E.U., highlight a need for third-party, independent assessments and verification of anti-IUU claims. To ensure our current and future FIPs are operating at a high level and to offer private sector approaches to complement legislative efforts towards the foundation of legal and sustainable fisheries globally, O2 will require the implementation of a CTS and verification of catch at origin in all of our FIPs. We will continue to explore alternate approaches for supply chain improvements for FIPs outside of the MSC process, as well as better methods for linking catch-to-processor traceability to existing traceability systems linking the processor to the final consumer. We will use this experience and apply it wherever we will work.
