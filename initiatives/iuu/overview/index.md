teaser-text: On a global scale, IUU fishing threatens the sustainability of fish stocks and ecosystems and accounts for USD23 billion in global economic loss annually. Currently, one in four fish is caught and traded illegally. Major seafood importers and retailers in key markets such are liable for the business risks of importing poached wildlife products but can not easily see where the risks occur or pathways to avoid them.

##Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing threatens the sustainability of fish stocks on a global scale and accounts for USD23 billion in global economic loss annually. 

Imports produced from illegal fishing present legal hazards for US seafood companies by violating the Lacey Act and by posing seafood fraud.  At the other end of the supply chain the vessel operators who fish illegally enjoy a considerable commercial advantage over legal fishing vessels, by lowering their costs and increasing their profits by not paying for access to marine resources and not complying with licensing and other regulations.  This advantage is achieved at the expense of the world’s poorest populations who rely upon fish as their primary source of protein.  As the Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) pointed out in a 2005 “Even in an industry as opaque as this, the bottom line is clear; fish pirates pursue their activities because it is profitable, and will keep pursuing it as long as their revenue exceeds their costs.”

IUU fishing occurs because the benefits gained from violating regulations outweigh the risk of detection and potential consequences.  Pirate fishing is economically driven, affecting a fishing industry worth USD110 billion worldwide, with the majority of the demand coming primarily from the US, European and Asian food markets.
