##These assessments will help inform policy, management, funding, and the direction of sustainable seafood work in Russia.

We developed a rapid assessment protocol based on a select group of 19 performance indicators within the three Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) principles. This methodology is the first of itâ€™s kind and is designed to be faster and cheaper than other assessment processes, and it provides a comprehensive baseline to inform the direction of sustainable seafood work in Russia. A complete explanation of this methodology and the results of the rapid assessments can be found below.
