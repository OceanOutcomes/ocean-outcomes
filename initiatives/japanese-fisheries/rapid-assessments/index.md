subtitle: We conducted eleven rapid assessments of strategically important Japanese fishery species to better articulate the Japanese fisheries landscape and to clearly map out the potential for fishery improvement and third party certification of fisheries targeting these species.

##These assessments will help inform policy, management, funding, and the direction of sustainable seafood work in Japan.

####Methodology:
We chose ten Japanese fishery species to evaluate from an initial list of the top 20 species by production volume, selecting those that are important to the global market or that appeared to have good potential for implementing improvements. We also assessed a specific Pacific bluefin tuna fishery for FIP scoping purposes given the importance of this species in Japan. First, we developed a rapid assessment protocol based on a select group of 19 performance indicators within the three Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) principles.

MSC previously determined that these specific indicators are especially predictive of scores at the principle level. We gathered fishery information and conducted the assessments, in which we summarized information within each MSC principle and assigned a scoring range (0-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100) to each performance indicator. Many of these species are harvested by multiple gear types, so we conducted the assessments at a more general level rather than focusing on specific gear types. Based on the information summaries, we identified key sustainability issues for each species as well as those shared across species. We also made an initial determination as to whether the fisheries for each species appeared suitable for MSC certification within the near term (roughly the next 5 years).

|**MSC Fisheries Standard**|[View the entire MSC standard here.] (https://www.google.com)|
|:---|:---|
|Principle 1:|Sustainable fish stocks - The fishing activity must be at a level which ensures it can continue indefinitely|
|Principle 2:|Minimizing environmental impact - Fishing operations must be managed to maintain the structure, productivity, function, and diversity of the ecosystem|
|Principle 3:| Effective management - The fishery must comply with relevant laws and have a management system that is responsive to changing circumstances|

To conduct the assessments we used information from stock assessments conducted by scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency of Japan (FRA) and from policy documents posted by the Japan Fisheries Agency (JFA). In the summaries below, we refer to FRA stock status determinations (low, medium, or high). The status may not be linked to actual fish abundance because it is often determined by dividing the range of past catches into thirds, and then seeing whether the most recent catch falls within the lower third (low), middle third (medium), or higher third (high). This FRA evaluation method is straightforward but fails to consider whether stock abundance is being maintained at an ecologically sustainable level. For tuna species we used reports from the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation and the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) that manage the respective tuna stocks.

Across all of the eleven species assessed, scoring ranges for performance indicators were lowest for MSC Principle 1 (Fig. 1). The lowest scores were for species that appear to have low population abundances based on stock assessments. For Principle 2, most performance indicators scored in the 60-80 range, largely due to uncertainty about the identity and status of non-target species as well as fishery impacts on these species. Scores were highest within Principle 3, but a substantial proportion of performance indicators did score below the 80 level. Any score below 60, that is orange or red, would cause the fishery to automatically fail the MSC assessment process.
