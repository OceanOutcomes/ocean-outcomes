The fishmonger of the seven seas. The largest seafood market in the world. Tsukiji. 

Tsukiji market in Tokyo stands at the center of a global seafood trade that reaches nearly every corner of the ocean, every fishing ground, and handles almost every conceivable seafood product. As the central node in the globalized seafood market, Tsukiji specifically, and Japan in general, has an incomparable influence on international seafood issues. Be it tuna, salmon, or sharks; Japan is a major player. Bottom line: sustainable fisheries will not be possible without Japan playing a constructive role.

The Japanese people are among the worlds leading users of seafood, consuming more than 66 kilograms of seafood per capita annually, three times the rate of the average American. In order to satisfy so many, Japan must import enormous volumes of seafood. In 2011, Japan imported 3 million tonnes of seafood, making it the second largest seafood importer globally. 

Domestic fisheries in Japan are in trouble. Due to a legacy of overfishing and habitat degradation, more than half of Japanese fisheries are collapsed or over-exploited according to the United Nations Fisheries and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO). This trend threatens one of the world’s largest fishing industries, which includes hundreds of thousands of people employed in catching, processing, transporting, and selling seafood. As domestic and international seafood supplies dwindle, Japanese fishers and consumers alike are, for the first time, starting to recognize the need for change. Public calls for reforms in domestic fishery management are becoming increasingly common. Slowly but surely, the first attempts at rights based and ecosystem based management practices are being tested. 

Nevertheless, Japan has yet to fully embrace seafood sustainability efforts. Only 10% of domestic fishery landings participate in the Marine Stewardship Certification (MSC) program, indicating a significant lag behind Russia, North America, and Europe. There is not a single publically recognized Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) in Japan. At O2, we’re working to change this.

Japan has much to gain from sustainable fisheries, but sustainability is still seen as a foreign concept. The truth is sustainability simply cannot be forced onto the Japanese from the outside. What is needed is an inside-outside approach. This includes working collaboratively and pragmatically with Japanese domestic fisheries that are working to make improvements, in order to demonstrate and scale Japanese models of sustainability that could form the basis for national and international level reforms.
