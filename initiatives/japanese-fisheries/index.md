## The fishmonger of the seven seas. The largest seafood market in the world. Tsukiji, Japan.  

Tsukiji market in Tokyo stands at the center of a global seafood trade that reaches nearly every corner of the ocean, every fishing ground, and handles almost every conceivable seafood product. As the central node in the globalized seafood market, Tsukiji specifically--and Japan in general--has an incomparable influence on international seafood issues. Be it tuna, salmon, or sharks; Japan is a major player. Bottom line: global sustainable fisheries will not be possible without Japan playing a constructive role.

It is well known that the Japanese people are among the worlds leading seafood aficionados, consuming more than 66 kilograms of seafood per capita annually, three times the rate of the average American. In order to satisfy so many, Japan must import and also produce enormous volumes of seafood.

It is less well known that many domestic fisheries in Japan are in deep trouble. Due to a legacy of overfishing and habitat degradation, more than half of Japanese fisheries are collapsed or over-fished according to the United Nations Fisheries and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO). This threatens one of the world’s largest fishing industries, which employs hundreds of thousands of people in catching, processing, transporting, and selling seafood. As domestic and international seafood supplies dwindle, Japanese fishers and consumers alike are, for the first time, starting to recognize the need for change. Public calls for reforms in domestic fishery management are becoming increasingly common. Slowly but surely, the first attempts at rights-based and ecosystem-based management practices are being tried. 

Nevertheless, Japan has yet to fully embrace modern seafood sustainability efforts. Only 10% of domestic fishery landings participate in the Marine Stewardship Certification (MSC) program, a significant lag behind Russia, North America, and Europe. There is not a single publically recognized Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) in Japan.
