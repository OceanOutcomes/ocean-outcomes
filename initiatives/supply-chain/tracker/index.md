The Salmon FIP Tracker was launched with the goal of providing stakeholders with easily accessible information on the sustainability status of a fishery and any progress being made toward fishery improvement goals. Buyers, conservation advocates, and others use the Tracker to verify and track improvement claims of salmon fisheries across the Pacific. 

The Tracker uses a scientific approach to track the improvement efforts underway in many of these fisheries, and while it contains information on all the major Pacific salmon fisheries, the focus of the Tracker is on fisheries in the improvement process. 

This tool allows buyers and conservation advocates to verify fisheriesâ€™ improvement claims and track the progress of individual fisheries online and will help ensure that only the fisheries living up to their sustainability commitments reap rewards in the sustainable seafood marketplace.
