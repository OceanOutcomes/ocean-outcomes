Central to our model of locally led, industry supported improvement projects is the Salmon FIP Partnership. A collaborative industry-based initiative of Ocean Outcomes and leading seafood companies across the Pacific Rim, the goal of the Partnership is to increase the volume of sustainable or improving wild capture salmon to 75% of global production.

The Partnership drives fishery improvement targets and outcomes, and continues to serve as a sector wide roundtable, stimulating demand for and incentivizing on the ground improvements of Russian and Japanese salmon fisheries. Additionally this pan-Pacific partnership stewards a number of regional improvement projects to address sustainability challenges such as overfishing, poaching, bycatch and hatchery impacts.

To learn more about the Partnership’s guiding principles, goals and progress, and fisheries it stewards visit the Salmon FIP Partnership website.
