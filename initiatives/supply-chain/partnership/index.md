Central to our model of locally led, industry supported improvement projects is the Salmon FIP Partnership. We launched the Partnership in collaboration with Wild Salmon Center and leading seafood companies and salmon producers across the Pacific Rim, with the goal of increasing the volume of sustainable or improving wild capture salmon to 75% of global production.

The Partnership drives fishery improvement targets and outcomes, and continues to serve as a sector wide roundtable, stimulating demand for and incentivizing on the ground improvements of Russian and Japanese salmon fisheries. Additionally this pan-Pacific partnership stewards a number of regional improvement projects to address sustainability challenges such as overfishing, poaching, bycatch and hatchery impacts.

To learn more about the Partnership’s guiding principles, goals and progress, and fisheries it stewards visit the Salmon FIP Partnership website.
