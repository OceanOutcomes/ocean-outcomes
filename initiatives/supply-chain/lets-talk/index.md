## DRAFT

This global supply chain event brought seafood businesses, managers, scientists and civil society together to identify solutions to pressing issues, strengthen business relations, and share best practices from Russia and internationally. 					
						
Participating in “Let’s Talk Salmon,” making new business connections, and understanding the origins of the salmon we buy, is one of the benefits of the Salmon FIP Partnership 

The discussion continued with presentation from the western guests about FIPs, what buyers want in terms of quality and product packaging, and encouragement to continue to “do great work, and work collaboratively with governmental agencies, NGOs and other stakeholders to achieve great results.” 
					
The Goal: to hold a Russian industry and international seafood buyer focused event to share best practices and examples of Russian salmon.
