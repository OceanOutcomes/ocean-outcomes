    For the past 15 years Charlie has had the unique opportunity to work with social entrepreneurs around the world. Those experiences have enabled him to design communities in amazing places from the high rises of New York to the forests of West Africa. The commonality among these experiences wasn’t related to a product or service, or in chasing sales or market share. Instead, it was an insight that social entrepreneurs hold a larger vision of what and who people wanted to become, and they produce a structure that allows people to work toward their aspirational identities. Context Partners was founded upon this insight and an awareness of the value it would generate when applied across sectors. Charlie and his team see answers readily available in the space between social change movements and the powerful institutions that could influence the world but are lacking the methods. Context Partners bridges this space for aspirational brands and causes by working at the cutting edge of the Community Centered Design movement.
