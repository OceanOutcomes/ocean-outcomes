He has lived and worked in Europe multiple times, traveled and volunteered in South America, and spends his summers commercial salmon fishing with his family in Bristol Bay, Alaska. In addition to his strong French and meager Spanish skills, he is learning Russian and can now piece together a handful of pathetic sentences.

    Julie has two decades of experience working with Russian fisheries.  At O2, she shepherds Russian fishermen through fishery improvement processes, wrangles cats and works to improve chain of custody and traceability in the global seafood supply chain by assisting with CoC certifications and other traceability improvements in the Russian fish processing sector.  After receiving her BA in Foreign Languages (Russian and French) from Lewis and Clark College, she worked for 13 seasons as part of a team running one of the most successful Atlantic salmon sport fishing lodges in the Russian arctic. After this extreme tundra experience, she returned to Portland and earned a MA in Communications from Portland State University. Upon graduation, she re-entered the world of Russian fisheries; this time focusing on Pacific salmon at the Wild Salmon Center in the Sustainable Fisheries Program.
