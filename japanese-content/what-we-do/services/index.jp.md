## Demand for sustainable seafood is at an all-time high. 

As a result, fisheries, seafood buyers, and conservation groups are looking for ways to increase the supply of sustainably caught fish by eliminating overfishing and IUU, minimizing bycatch of depleted non-target species, and reducing negative habitat impact. At O2, we create opportunities to increase sustainable seafood supply by improving fisheries and reducing these risks.

We work with fisheries, seafood businesses, seafood ranking/certification programs and conservation organizations to:  

* Design, launch, and/or implement fishery improvement projects
* Conduct fishery assessments 
* Develop fishery assessment criteria
* Develop comprehensive risk analysis reports on fisheries
* Convene stakeholders and companies throughout the seafood supply chain 
* Assist fisheries in making connections in the marketplace
* Facilitate independent observers and IUU audits

Benefits derived from our work include:

* Risk mitigation for businesses and communities
* Healthy and robust fisheries that deliver long-term business value from responsible environmental stewardship
* Market recognition for improving fisheries, particularly in the North American and European markets where demand for sustainability is high
* Increased potential to attract investment based on the implementation of sustainable practices

Whether you are a fishermen, seafood buyer/supplier or NGO advising on seafood sustainability, [get in touch] (/contact/) today to explore how we can work with you to increase the supply of sustainable seafood.
