<h2>At Ocean Outcomes, we work hand in hand with commercial fisheries to help them become more sustainable.</h2>

Our fishery improvement work addresses the full range of major fishery challenges contributing to the global fisheries crisis. These challenges include [Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU)] (/initiatives/iuu/), overfishing, depletion of non-target stocks, habitat impacts, and management system issues such as inadequate monitoring. These issues represent serious risks to the sustainability and security of fisheries, food supplies, and human livelihoods.

<h5>Our Fishery Improvement Work Includes:</h5>

----

  * The design, launch, and implementation of fishery improvement projects 
  * Supply chain analysis and mapping
  * Traceability and independent observer programs
  * Buyer partnership facilitation
  * Fishery marketplace engagement strategy development
  * Bycatch reduction programs
  * Fishermen and seafood buyer exchanges
  * Seafood supply chain stakeholder convenings

Many commercial fisheries work at the margins of profitability and have limited capacity on their own to improve the sustainability of their fisheries-- that’s where we come in. Our hands-on partnership approach helps fisheries achieve meaningful improvements and allows all stakeholders to reap the tangible benefits of sustainability.
