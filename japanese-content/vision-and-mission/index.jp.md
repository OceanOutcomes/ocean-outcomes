<h2>More sustainable fisheries</h2>

At O2, weâ€™re dedicated to improving high risk fisheries globally-- the fisheries that face the toughest sustainability issues and have the most to gain from improvements. We work hand-in-hand with commercial fisheries to design plans for improvement, and we stick around to help them achieve these goals. 

**We envision** a future with healthy aquatic ecosystems, a plentiful and profitable wild seafood supply, and thriving fishing communities.

**Our mission** is to work with communities and the seafood industry to improve the sustainability of high risk fisheries. We cultivate deep relationships with fishermen, seafood buyers, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to uncover and implement local solutions to systems level problems in globally significant fisheries.

**Our experience** on the water is strong. Incubated and launched by [Wild Salmon Center] (http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org), O2 builds on a decade of work promoting sustainable wild salmon fisheries. In our new, independent form we are a global fishery improvement organization, concentrating our entire mission on helping fisheries become sustainable so that they continue to produce healthy seafood and income for fishing communities well into the future.
